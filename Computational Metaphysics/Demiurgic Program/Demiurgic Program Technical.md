## Notes
* A Demiurgic System is paradox consisting of one or more observable processes binded to one another, such that the input of a process is involves a dependency on its output.
* The evidation of observed propositions augments process representation over a period of time.
* Each succession is isomorphic to a recursive call 
* Successions can be abstracted

## Tasks
- [ ] Develop representation [[Process Representation]] so we can understand subject and object.
- [ ] Develop formal representation of evidation in [[Mechanics of Evidence Production]]
- [ ] Develop formal examples of demiurgic systems
	- [ ] single
	- [ ] dual
	- [ ] multiple
- [ ] Simulate a demiurgic program
