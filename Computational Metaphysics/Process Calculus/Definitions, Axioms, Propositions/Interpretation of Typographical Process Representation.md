Def : 0.0 : **Process** : We define a process as an abstraction that processes information, isomorphic to the theorems of the form described in [Axiom 0.0]

Def : 1.0 : **Observation** : Given a process represented by valid theorem, the output of the process becomes the input when performing the operation defined in [Axiom 0.6]. We refer to this as an observation.

Def : 2.0 : **Discriminatory Observation** : The first term in an observation as described in [Axiom 0.6]

Def : 3.0 : **Generative Observation** : The last term in observation as described [Axiom 0.6]
