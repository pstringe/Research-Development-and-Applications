- [x] Interpret a theorem in the process calculus using paradox mechanics ✅ 2023-06-11
- [x] Review and update the concepts of abstraction and expression from [[abstraction evaluation]]. ✅ 2023-06-13
- [x] Use the information from the previous step to define recursive indeterminate abstractions to update definitions in the process calculus. ✅ 2023-06-13
- [ ] Define [[Process Representation]] which how is we think about subjective experience.
	- [ ] Define subject and object
	- [ ] meta-representations
	- [ ] hyper/sub-spaces
- [ ] Examine the concept of information sources
	- [ ] Transcribe notes on [[Everything Mechanic]], and formalize using set theory.
	- [ ] Examine the concept of the epimenedes paradox
- [ ] Examine and formalize the concept of information sources and expression using functional encoding of the everything abstraction.
- [ ] Instantaneous Evidence Production
	- [ ] Examine conditional logic in the context evidation
---

- [ ] Review propositions that involve evidation and Ivedation
	- Ivedation: the production of evidence supporting the interpretation of output from a bound process.
- [ ] Formalize definition of evidation and ivedation
- [ ] Use process calculus to describe the mechanics evidation and Ivedation mechanics
	- [ ] Describe use the process calculus to describe the problem with Ivedating programs in London
	- [ ] Describe causality and the specific cases of Ivedation  that resulted in the evidation of anthropomorphic metaphysical entities
	- [ ] Explain the problems the subject had with meditation that resulted from the programs the subject was Ivedating
	- [ ] Briefly explain the law of detachment and the intelligence mechanics at play
	- [ ] Explain the solutions that were developed to replace meditation
	- [ ] Explain the purpose of the project, to evidate the propositions of the indeterminate logic for anyone else that might find the methods useful.
