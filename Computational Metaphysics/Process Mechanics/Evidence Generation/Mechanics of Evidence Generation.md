## Propositions
Given the definitions and axioms of the [[Process Calculus]], we define evidation as the following:
![[Prop-EM-0.1-Interpretation_of_Observable Process]]
![[Def-EM-0.0-Succession]]
![[Def-EM-5-Evidation]]
![[Prop-EM-0.2]]
![[Prop-EM-0.3]]
![[Iso-EM-0.4]]
![[Prop-EM-0.5]]
![[Prop-EM-0.6]]
