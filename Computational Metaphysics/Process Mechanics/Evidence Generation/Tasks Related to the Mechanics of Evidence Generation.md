- [ ] Review propositions that involve evidation and Ivedation
	- Ivedation: the production of evidence supporting the interpretation of output from a bound process.
- [ ] Formalize definition of evidation and ivedation
- [ ] Use process calculus to describe the mechanics evidation and Ivedation mechanics
	- [ ] Describe use the process calculus to describe the problem with Ivedating programs in London
	- [ ] Describe causality and the specific cases of Ivedation  that resulted in the evidation of anthropomorphic metaphysical entities
	- [ ] Explain the problems the subject had with meditation that resulted from the programs the subject was Ivedating
	- [ ] Briefly explain the law of detachment and the intelligence mechanics at play
	- [ ] Explain the solutions that were developed to replace meditation
	- [ ] Explain the purpose of the project, to evidate the propositions of the indeterminate logic for anyone else that might find the methods useful.
