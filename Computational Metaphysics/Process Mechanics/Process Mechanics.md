In [[Process Mechanics]], we utilize [[Process Calculus]] describe the evolution of and interactions between metaphysical abstractions. We also describe how the the information represented in the process calculus relates to a process's representation of itself in [[Process Representation]].

Prop : IM : 0.0 : There are at least two models for expressing process interactions 

Prop : IM : 0.1 : Composable abstraction

Prop : IM : 0.2 : Graph Abstraction

Prop : IM : 0.3 : Every process is represented by the host

## 2 Process System (Graph Abstraction)
Def : PM : 0.0 : `compound edge` : Given a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), we consider the edges of the graph to be a [compound abstraction](Def-PC-0.1.3-compound_abstraction.md).

Def : PM : 0.1 : `binding` : Given a `compound edge`, we refer to the expressed `abstractions` as `bindings`. Each `binding` relates 2 `abstractions` 

Prop : PM : 1.0 : We represent `P1` and `P2` as vertices on a `graph`, related by a `compound edge`.

Prop : PM : 1.1 : Given `P1 := x1 ) P1 ) y1`

Prop : PM : 1.2 : Given `P2 := x2 ) P2 ) y2`

Prop : PM : 1.3 : Given `eX(x1) === ex(y2)` 

Prop : PM : 1.4 : Each abstraction of `eX(x1)` is bound to the corresponding abstractions of `ex(x2)`
