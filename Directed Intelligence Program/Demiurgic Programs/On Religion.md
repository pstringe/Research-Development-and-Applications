0. The mechanism by which a deity, such as a god, a spirit or a demon, may be evinced is no different from the mechanism by which all phenomena are evinced (T).

1. I attempt to describe this mechanism in [Mechanics and Elucidation of Evidence](Mechanics%20and%20Elucidation%20of%20Evidence.md). For most people, the generation of evidence that supports a given proposition requires the acceptance of the proposition (T). 

2. It is easy for a person to dismiss another person's religion as false if they've not accepted accepted the propositions of that religion's doctrine (T).

3. There exist people who do not need to accept the propositions in order to evince the propositions (A).
