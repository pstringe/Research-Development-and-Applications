0. Metaphysical entities (ME) such as spirits, gods, deities, energy-fields, are [evinced](Def-EM-0.4-Evidence_Generation) by the person observing them (T).

1. They can be described using logical/mathematical/computational abstractions (T).

2. One such abstraction that can be used to describe an ME is a [process](Def-PC-0.0-Process).

3. An anthropomorphic entity (AE) can be described using an observable [observable process](Def-4.0-Observable_Process.md).

5. They are created as a result of observing material that references them (T).

6. They are operated indirectly by humans (T).

7. Not all humans that operate metaphysical entities are aware that they are operating them.

8. The means by which this is accomplished can be represented using a temporal graph abstraction (A).

9. I describe one such abstraction in [[Process Mechanics and Interactions]] (A).
