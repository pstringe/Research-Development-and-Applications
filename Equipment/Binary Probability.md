PROP : BP : 8 : In a binary probability space, each observation constrains the possibility space by removing the observed abstraction

PROP : BP : 9 : This constraint is equivalent to updating a binary probability space

PROP : BP : 10 : We define a probability space by mapping each possibility of the possibility space to a combination composed of the values of the value space

PROP : BP : 11 : V = { 1 0 } where (0 | 1)
COMMENT : BO : 11 : We define a value dimension V that contains the positions 1 and 0, were 0 is left adjacent to 1 establishing counting order. 

PROP : BP : 12 : $(R = ( p\ q )$

PROP : BP : 13 : $$S = ( 
						(0 0) 
						(0 1) 
						(1 0) 
						(1 1)
					)$$

COMMENT : BP : 13 : We define a possibility space using dimensions V and R.

PROP : BP : 14 : P = (
						((0 0) 1)
						((0 1) 1)
						((1 0) 1)
						((1 1) 1)
					)

PROP : BP : 15 : Given the observations in [PL-fig_7](PL-fig_7), each observation constrains the possibility space by removing the proposition representing the observed abstraction. From the possibility space.

PROP : BP : 16 : $01\ )\ 00\ )\ P\ )\ 01$, $CS(S) = (\10, 11)\$

PROP : BP : 17 : 
```
(C(S) = {10 11}) -> (
						U(P) = (
							(00 0) 
							(01 0) 
							(10 1) 
							(11 1)
						)
					)
```

PROP : BP : 18 :
