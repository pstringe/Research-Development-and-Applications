FINAL : MPL : 0.0 : Maintain a list of methods to elaborate upon

DEF : MPL : 0.1 : Logic : A set of rules to facilitate the manipulation of a meta-representation, consisting of abstractions of information. Such that isomorphisms between abstractions of the representation, and abstractions of the meta-representation are preserved. 

1. Given a information of a representation
2. Enumerate abstractions of the information of the representation
3. Enumerate abstract relationships between abstractions
4. Define a set of rules for manipulating the abstractions, such that the corresponding meta-representation is conceivable.
