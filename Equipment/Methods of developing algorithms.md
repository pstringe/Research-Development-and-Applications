DEF : 0.0 : Methods of developing algorithm
1. Articulate the constraints of the problem.
2. Represent propositions isomorphic to the described abstractions.
3. Develop an example input and its corresponding output.
4. Develop a spatial meta-representation of the example input in relation to the desired output.
