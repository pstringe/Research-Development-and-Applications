REQ : PA : 3.0 : We shall analyze the tokenized propositions for the purpose of implementing an NLP algorithm transform propositions in natural language to formal equivalents.
REQ : PA : 3.1 : Regarding the analysis of sets of propositions, we've already developed a non-deterministic method of checking for contradictions.
REQ : PA : 3.2 :  Enumerate the sets of valid propositions, and apply the algorithm to each set to return a set of consistent sets.
REQ : PA : 3.3 : For each relevant set of consistent propositions, we will utilize the non-deterministic computation to resolve uncertainty regarding edge cases.
