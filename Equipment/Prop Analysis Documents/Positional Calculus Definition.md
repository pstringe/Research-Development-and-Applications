## Notes
1. Given a set of abstractions A
2. Each abstraction can be described by n attributes
3. Each attribute can have m `possible values`
4. We describe each `possible value` as a `position`

## Axioms
*Axiom : POSC : 0.0*: A lowercase letter, such as `x` represents an `abstraction`.

*Axiom : POSC : 1.0*: An uppercase letter, such as `X` represents an `position`.

*Axiom : POSC : 2.0*: The theorem `(x | y)`  is interpreted as `x` is left adjacent to y.

*Axiom : POCS : 3.0*: The theorem `(x |-| y)` is 
interpreted as `x` is positioned left of `y`.

*Axiom : POCS : 3.0*: The theorem `(x|)` is interpreted as, `x` is in the first position.

*Axiom : POCS : 5.0*: The theorem `(|y)` is interpreted as, `y` is the last term. 

Prop : POCS : 6.0: The theorem `X == Y` is interpreted as, position `X` maps to position `Y`.
