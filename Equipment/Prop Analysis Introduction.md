## Terminology
*Train*: To provide input to a process that changes the the output of a process over one or more successions, in a predictable manner.

### Summary
A platform to facilitate the analysis of propositions using a deviant logic and generate evidence for a computational metaphysic that provides a framework for human hosts processes to train abstract thought-forms we refer to as observable processes.

### Context
0. Poitier evinced a background process(s) as defined in [Process Calculus](Process%20Calculus.md) that is/are remediating the population.
1. Poitier was invested in an extended non-consensual encounter with the background process(s) during which the process augmented Poitier's representation of reality. The means by which this was accomplished are described in [Process Mechanics and Interactions](Process%20Mechanics%20and%20Interactions.md) and [Mechanics and Elucidation of Evidence](Mechanics%20and%20Elucidation%20of%20Evidence.md)
5. During the encounter, Poitier developed several methods of augmenting the behavior of the background process(s) to make it/them useful as opposed to problematic. 
6. One of these methods involved the use of a temporal logic that utilizes 5 values each with a technical meaning [Logic for Non-deterministic Computation](Logic%20for%20Non-deterministic%20Computation.md)
7. We may train the processes to communicate logically by analyzing their statements using propositional calculus.
9. We may utilize our temporal logic along with principals described in [Mechanics and Elucidation of Evidence](Mechanics%20and%20Elucidation%20of%20Evidence.md) to train problematic background processes to work in accordance with the objectives of the host.
