## Terminology
*Train*: To provide input to a process that changes the the output of a process over one or more successions, in a predictable manner.

### Summary
A platform to facilitate the analysis of propositions using a deviant logic and generate evidence for a computational metaphysic that provides a framework for human hosts processes to train abstract thought-forms we refer to as observable processes.

### Context
0. Poitier evinced a background process(s) as defined in [[Process Calculus]] that is/are remediating the population.
1. Poitier was invested in an extended non-consensual encounter with the background process(s) during which the process augmented Poitier's representation of reality. The means by which this was accomplished are described in [[Process Mechanics]] and [[Mechanics of Evidence Generation]]
5. During the encounter, Poitier developed several methods of augmenting the behavior of the background process(s) to make it/them useful as opposed to problematic. 
6. One of these methods involved the use of a temporal logic that utilizes 5 values each with a technical meaning [[Logic for Nondeterministic Computation]]
7. We may train the processes to communicate logically by analyzing their statements using propositional calculus.
9. We may utilize our temporal logic along with principals described in [[Mechanics of Evidence Generation]] to train problematic background processes to work in accordance with the objectives of the host.
