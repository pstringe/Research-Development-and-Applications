Final : Given a `prima_representation`  in the form of an array of characters, and a `value_dimension` in the form of an array of characters calculate and display `n` $hallucinatory\ sucessions$ as described in [[Representative Number Theory]].

OBJ : given a string input, tokenize and encode using representative number theory.

**Constraints**
0. Given a plurality of propositions, sort by significance
1. Provide a plurality of values for the value space 
2. Enumerate the possibility space
3. Given the possibility space, generate the space of possible generations.

**Questions**
0. How will propositions be read and stored?
	* We will read propositions from a file and store them in an array of structs.
1. How will we display the generations?
	* We will display observations of a generation using hierarchical indentation.

**Currently**
0. Given a prima representation read in as a string, and a number indicating a number of successions, we may output a number reflecting that number of determinate successions. (currently there is a segfault)

My job is that I know exactly how we operate. And every adverse action I'd be willing to take is someone else would be as well.
