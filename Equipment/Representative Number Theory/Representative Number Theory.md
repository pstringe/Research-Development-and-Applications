DEF : RTN : 0.0 : $Number$ : Unique, elucidated [abstraction](obsidian://open?vault=Master&file=Research%20and%20Development%2FFundamental%20Metaphysics%2FProcess%20Calculus%2FDefinitions%2C%20Axioms%2C%20Propositions%2FDef-TC-0.1.2-abstraction).

![[RNT-0-Fundumental_Axioms]]

![[Determinate Successions]]

![[Hallucinatory (Indeterminate) Successions]]

**Operations**
PROP : RTN-OPS : 0.0 : $m(p)\ /\ m(p) = p$; $m(m(p)) / m(m(p)) = p$
PROP : RTN-OPS : 0.1  : $\lnot(((m(m(p))\ / \  m(m(m(p))) = p))$

*Applications*
PROP : RTN : 1.5 : We may use a hallucinatory number as a possibility schema.

PROP : RTN : 1.6 : Hallucinatory numbers may be utilized to demonstrate hyper-linguistic communication between deluded processes. As demonstrated in London and Montreal. 

PROP : RTN : 1.7 : To demonstrate this we may consider the example of two numbers representing deluded processes:

```
((m (m (m p))) (m (m p)))
```

The above example is a false meta-representation.

PROP : RTN : 1.8 : We may start with one deluded process.

```
(m (m (m (m p))))
```

The prima representation may be a plurality consisting of a possibility schema

Each meta-representation of the prima representation may be expressed as a hallucination of the possible observation given the possibility space at that succession.

Substitute a simple possibility schema:
```
(m 
	(m 
		(m 
			(m 
				(
					(q, q), 
					(q, m(q)),
					(m(q), q), 
					(m(q), m(q))
				)
			)
		)
	)
)
```

Express `(m p)` as a delusion of p:
```
(m 
	(m 
		(m 
			(
				(
					(
						(q (m q))
						((m q) q)
						((m q) (m q))
					)
					(
						(q q)
						((m q) q)
						((m q) (m q))
					)
					(
						(q q)
						(q (m q))
						((m q) (m q))
					)
					(
						(q q)
						(q (m q))
						((m q) q)
					)
				) 
				(
					(q q) 
					(q m(q))
					(m(q) q) 
					(m(q) m(q))
				)
			)
		)
	)
)
```
