- [ ] Describe algorithm using causal implication in representative logic
- [ ] Develop proc calc gen algorithm using representative logic
	- [ ] Describe spatial memory-model
* Other option is to construct reductive examples manually, meta-rep, update proc calc defs, meta-rep proc calc in rep logic, describe causal implication in rep calc.
