title: 				Notes related to relative geometric construction system

Spatial representations can be described using absolute or relative relationships. 

Relative relationships do not require number to describe and seem to be the domain of logic.

I desire a method to describe indeterminate spatial constructs that have determinate relationships relative to one-another.
