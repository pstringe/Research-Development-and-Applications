Def-PC-0.4.0
Def : PC : 0.4.0 : $Evaluation$ (a-causal): Given a theorem of the form, $F\ |\ F\ |\ (m F)$, the last term, in this case, $(m\ F)$, the temporal meta-representation is $F$'s evaluation of the left-most term in the theorem, $F$, where $F\ \neq (m\ F)$. 
==Since writing this we've eliminated the need to discuss a temporal meta-rep==

Def : PC : 0.4.1 : $Evaluation$ (causal): Given a theorem of the form, $F\ |\ F\ |\ (m\ F)$, the last term, in this case, $(m\ F)$, is $F$'s evaluation of the left-most term in the theorem, $F$. In the case of $F$. This is isomorphic to, ($f(o)\ \Rightarrow\ (m \ o)$) in the [[Abstract Representative Calculus]].
