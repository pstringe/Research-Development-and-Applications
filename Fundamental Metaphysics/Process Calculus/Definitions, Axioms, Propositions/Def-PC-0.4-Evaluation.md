Def-PC-0.4.0
Def : PC : 0.4.0 : $Evaluation$ (a-causal): Given a theorem of the form, $F\ )\ F\ )\ (m F)$, the last term, in this case, $(m\ F)$, is $F$'s evaluation of the left-most term in the theorem, $F$, where $F\ \neq (m\ F)$. 

Def : PC : 0.4.1 : $Evaluation$ (causal): Given a theorem of the form, $o_n\ )\ F\ )\ o_{n+1}$, the last term, in this case, $o_{n+1}$, is $F$'s evaluation of the left-most term in the theorem, $o_i$, where $i\ \neq n+1$. In the case of $F$, $(o_f = o_n)$, therefore, $o_{n + 1}$ is $F$'s evaluation of $o_n$. This is isomorphic to, $f(o_n)\ \Rightarrow\ o_{n + 1}$ in the [[Abstract Representative Calculus]].
