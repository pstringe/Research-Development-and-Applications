1. [Prop]  Given [Axiom 1], if we provide the constraint `i !=== o`, the process functions as an epimenedes paradox  
2. [Prop]  [Prop 1] is false under the interpretation that the model is included in the form of a process. 
3. [Prop]  Implementing the epimenedes paradox in the process requires self-reference.
4. [Prop] Self-reference is implicit in [Process Representation](Process%20Representation.md)
5. [Prop] Time is a resolution to to the epimenedes paradox
