title: 				Regarding the indeterminate logic, how do we know if one of a symbols contingent relationships constrains it's value?

I think we can gain insight into this questions from the rules we defined for evaluating natural language propositions.

![[Natural Language Application of Indeterminate Logic]]

## Notes
0. [Prop] We have a recursive abstraction that can relate to other recursive abstractions [Given]
1. [Prop] We want to demonstrate all of the ways in which symbols in natural language can relate to one another [Given]
2. [Prop] We want to understand which sets of related abstractions make sense and which ones don't [Given]
3. [Expr] `X` `make sense`: are isomorphic to the subject's representation of reality [Given]
4. [Prop] If [Prop 2] we [[ought]] to 
5. [Prop] In our current representation of an abstraction, relationships are implicit in the `expression`.
6. [Prop] If the value of an `abstraction` , `D` within an `expression`, `E.expression`, is `U` or `C` then `E` is `contingent` in relation to `D`
7. [Prop] If the value of an `abstraction`, `D` within an `expression`, `E.expression`, is `T` or `F`, `A` or `R` then `E` is `determinate` in relation to `D`

## Notes
0. [Prop] `T` and `F` refer to the current `state`
1. [Prop] `A` and `R` refer to future states
2. [Prop] An expression the form, `P==A` can be reformulated as `In the future, P==T`
3. [Prop Ax] If `P==A`  we can assume, `~(P==T)`

*Conclusion*: The question in the title was ill-formulated and motivated by my use of a similar concept in the context of the [[Scale Problem]]. 

0. [Prop] if the `abstraction`, `A` is contingent in relation to `B`, the value of  `A` is constrained by `B`.
