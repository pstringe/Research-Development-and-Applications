The process calculus is a tool for representing the evolution of a self-representing [representative abstraction](Def-TC-0.0-representative_abstraction).

In time, we refer to this as a process. The process abstraction is used to demonstrate a [temporal solution to representative paradox](Temporal Solution to Representative Paradox (Observer's Paradox), an observer's paradox.

*Demonstrate the expression of abstractions in a simple process using [Representative Number Theory](Representative%20Number%20Theory.md)*

# We use (proc x) to denote a theorem of process calculus
# (:= a b) : a may be expressed as b

(:=
	(proc (' 
		F
	))
	(proc (' 
		F | F | (m F)
	))
)

# Isomporphic data-structure for describing state of a simple process

	F     # input
	F     # p-space
	(mf)  # output
