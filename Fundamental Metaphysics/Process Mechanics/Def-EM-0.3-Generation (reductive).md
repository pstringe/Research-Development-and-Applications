Def : EM : 0.3 :Â $generation$ : Given an initial *[observation](Axiom-PC-0.1-Observation)*, the *[initial cause](Def-EM-0.1-Initial_Cause.md)*, and a final *[observation](Axiom-PC-0.1-Observation)*, the *[final cause](Def-EM-0.2-Final_Cause.md)*, of a generation is, reductively, an ordered plurality of *[successions](Def-EM-0.0-Succession)* beginning with the *[succession](Def-EM-0.0-Succession)* of the *[initial cause](Def-EM-0.1-Initial_Cause.md)*, and ending with the *[succession](Def-EM-0.0-Succession)* of the observation previous to the *[final cause](Def-EM-0.2-Final_Cause.md)*.

Ex : EM : 5.1 : example of generation

```
		(p F) )            F  )             (m F)
		(m F) )         (m F) )         (m (m F))
	(m (m F)) )   (m (m (F))) )     (m (m (m F)))
(m (m (m F))) ) (m (m (m F))) ) (m (m (m (m F))))
```

The *[successions](Def-EM-0.0-Succession)* of example 5.1 represent a $generation$ where $x$ represents the *[initial cause](Def-EM-0.1-Initial_Cause.md)* of the expressed [generation](d and $z$ represents the *[final cause](Def-EM-0.2-Final_Cause.md)* of the $generation$.
