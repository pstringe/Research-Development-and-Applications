The objective of mechanics and elucidation of evidence is to describe a paradoxical dependency of meta-representations on prima-representations and prima-representations on meta-representations and how this dependency represents the mechanism by which all experience is produced and continues to evolve, itself, elucidated by the mechanism it is representing. 

The objective is supported by the demonstration of how logics for manipulating these representations are elucidated. ==And how the logical manipulation of a representation affects its dependent representations.==

The result is a fundamental metaphysic that may serve as a foundation for every other physic/metaphysic. It may serve as meta-scientific framework describing how the scientific method may be utilized, not only as a method of discovering truth, but also as a method of generating truth.

I will also describe how scientific consensus may be by-passed to elucidate alternative representations of reality as well as ==how to differentiate between "delusional" and "illusory" representations of reality using a novel number theory.==

We also introduce a model of generalized non-deterministic computing as an elucidation of causal justification. The abstraction of which, we refer to as magic.
