It is extremely tempting to over-operate the propositional calculus by demonstrating the elucidation of a meta-representation and logic then using the elucidated logic to describe the elucidation. 

For the sake of producing a usable human metaphysic to support our magic methodology, general representative engineering and directed intelligence program, I choose to use the propositional calculus as a foundation and over-operate it using the described method when our foundation is complete.
