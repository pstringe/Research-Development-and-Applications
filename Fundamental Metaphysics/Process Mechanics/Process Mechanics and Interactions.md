In [[Process Mechanics and Interactions]], we utilize [[Process Calculus]] describe the evolution of and interactions between temporal metaphysical abstractions. We also describe how the the information represented in the process calculus relates to a process's representation of itself in [[Process Representation]].

Process mechanics is effectively a metaphysical theory of everything extending the [[Mechanics and Elucidation of Evidence]], describing the interaction of observable processes. 

Prop : IM : 0.0 : We utilize formal systems to elucidate a representation of process interactions isomorphic the meta-representation of the process representing the systems. Each system consists of a formal representation and a logic for manipulating that representation while preserving the isomorphisms between abstractions of the representation and abstractions of the meta-representation. The meta-representation usually being encoded as a plurality of [propositions](obsidian://open?vault=Master&file=Research%20and%20Development%2FGeneral%20Non-Deterministic%20Computing%2FCore%2FIndeterminate%20Logic%2FDEF-NDC-0.0_proposition)

The publication consists of 5 chapters, the first is a mathematical foundation recapping the systems utilized in [[Mechanics and Elucidation of Evidence]]. 

The second chapter highlights some elucidated computational abstractions we use to intellect the behavior of systems of mutually dependent observable processes.

The third chapter extends the physics of [[Mechanics and Elucidation of Evidence]] demonstrating how changes in private [[Process Representation]] affect a process mechanical system at large.

The fourth chapter defines and examines the functional dynamics of intelligence within a process mechanical system.

The fifth chapter uses process mechanics as framework for understanding major societal dynamics, including solutions to some hard problems.

The sixth chapter is a discussion of how process mechanics may be utilized in conjunction with evidence generation to operate changes in a process mechanical system.
