In [[Process Mechanics]], we utilize [[Process Calculus]] describe the evolution of and interactions between metaphysical abstractions. We also describe how the the information represented in the process calculus relates to a process's representation of itself in [[Process Representation]].

Prop : IM : 0.0 : There are at least two models for expressing process interactions 

Prop : IM : 0.1 : Composable abstraction

Prop : IM : 0.2 : Graph Abstraction

Prop : IM : 0.3 : Every process is represented by the host
