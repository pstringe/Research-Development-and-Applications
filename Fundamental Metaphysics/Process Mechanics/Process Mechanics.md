In [[Process Mechanics]], we utilize [[Process Calculus]] describe the evolution of and interactions between temporal metaphysical abstractions. We also describe how the the information represented in the process calculus relates to a process's representation of itself in [[Process Representation]].
Prop : IM : 0.0 : There are at least three models for expressing process interactions 
Prop : IM : 0.1 : Representative abstraction (a-temporal)
Prop : IM : 0.2 : Process abstraction (temporal)
Prop : IM : 0.2 : Graph Abstraction (a-temporal)
PROP : IM : 0.3 : Temporal-Graph (temporal)
Prop : IM : 0.4 : Every process is represented by the host
Prop
