## Derivation of the observer paradox
### Standard Form
0. Generation is the successive association of symbols
1. The generation of a thing is processing
2. The self is a process
3. Identification is the association of a self symbol with another symbol
4. Identification with processing is thought, the action of which is thinking
5. Sensation is information encoded in a sensory medium
6. Of things, some are external to the self and others internal
7. A phenomenon is an external thing associated with sensation
8. A noumenon is an internal thing associated with a symbol or symbols
9. A symbol is a relationship between a noumenon and other (symbols or phenomena)
10. noumena are thought
11. phenomena are observed
12. The observation of a phenomenon implies the existence of the phenomenon
13. The existence of a phenomenon implies the existence of a thing isomorphic to that phenomenon.
14. All noumena are thought
15. All phenomena are observed
16. Things not observed are not thought
17. Things thought are observed
18. An observer is a thing describing that which enables observation
19. If the observer observes phenomena associated with an observer it has not observed that which observed the phenomena. 
20. Of observable phenomena, there are none associated with an observer that can be observed. (The observer does not observe itself)
21. The observer exists

## Solution 1: To the Observer Paradox
Summary: Observers do not exist in isolation. Such that the existence of one involves the existence of another.

## Questions
1. What is the difference between a process and an observer
	* The observer is a non-entity.
	* If this is the case, there is no need for Solution 1, Justification: The observer does not need to exists just the phenomena associated with it. (bodies)
2. How is the observer passed. That is, how do processes take turns manipulating the construct?

## Natural lang
Every observation is an act of processing that includes both discrimination and generation.

When examining a proposition, the first question to ask is, am I interested in learning about my representation of reality or augmenting it?

If the user is invested in learning about their representation, they may use reason to evaluate the proposition as true or false.

If the user is invested in augmenting their representation ethical reasoning to evaluate the proposition as accepted or rejected.

If the proposition is accepted, it is likely to reflect the state of affairs at a future point.

If the proposition is rejected, it is unlikely to reflect the state of affairs at a future point.

The aforementioned methods resolve uncertainty.

The user may also increase uncertainty by evaluating a proposition as indeterminate state
