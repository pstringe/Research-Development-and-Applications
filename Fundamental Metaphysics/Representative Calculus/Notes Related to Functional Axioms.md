## Set 1
0. Thought is fundamental
1. You are a thought
2. You are what you think you are
3. A thought is what it thinks it is 
4. If a thought thinks it is not what it thinks it is, then a thought is not what it thinks it is
5. If it (a thought) is not what it thinks it is then it is not what it is
6. it is not what it is
7. The truth of 6 cannot be evaluated
8. If a thing is thought in time, time can be interpreted as a resolution to 6's paradox
9. A thing is not what it thought it was

## Set 2
0. Things are fundamental
2. A thing is what you think it is
3. You are a thing
4. A thing is what it thinks it is
5. If a thing thinks it is what it is not, it is what it is not
6. it is what it is not
7. The truth of 6 cannot be evaluated
8. If a thing is thought in time, time can be interpreted as a resolution to 6's paradox
9. it is not what it was

Comment : NFA : 1.1 : The natural language proposition, [Prop-NFA-1.0](Prop-NFA-1.0.md), implies persistence, and like [Prop-NFA-0.0](Prop-NFA-0.0.md), time. This may be useful for describing the resolution of uncertainty in simulation.

![Prop-NFA-1.2](Prop-NFA-1.2.md)

Comment : NFA : 1.2 : Our [Axioms of the abstract Calculus](Axioms%20of%20the%20abstract%20Calculus.md) do not make obvious the relationship between thought and sensory information in time. This is clarified in the process calculus. [Notes on the relationship between thought and being and sensation](Notes%20on%20the%20relationship%20between%20thought%20and%20being%20and%20sensation.md).

[2023-08-18](2023-08-18.md)
We are moving away from thought/thing to abstraction/representative-abstractions. The formalization of which is compatible with a thought/thing technical interpretation. We are revising via over-operation. To account for the fact that thoughts and things are not the only form of representation. And while a classical idealist or a neo-platonic philosopher may subsume matter into thought, not all minds will agree with this distinction. 

A representative calculus may be interpreted so as to elucidate  meta-representations compatible with particular process meta-representations.
