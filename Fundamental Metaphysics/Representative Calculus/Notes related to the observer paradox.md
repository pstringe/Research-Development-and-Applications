#### Writing related to the observer paradox
1. [[Early Derivation of the observer paradox]]

Analysis and justification of [[Prop-0p-0.4]]. 
0. One concern is that we don't have a hard acceptance criteria for classifying a proposition as justified aside from it seeming so. 
1. We can manipulate our mathematical propositions using the propositional calculus. 
2. But when we switch to manipulating our interpretations of the propositions, we create a level of ambiguity that may be fine for a casual reader but is certainly not rigorous.
3. One method I think we could use, is to represent a logic using the representative calculus.
4. We can assume certain propositions are given. We know the logic describing how the acceptance of propositions augments process representation will be described in the mechanics of evidence generation. And once the reader has accepted those propositions, the justification will no longer be necessary.  
5. The representative calculus is a formal representation, not a logic. If we perform reductive manipulations of examples in the rep calculus, classify the manipulations, and formalize, it will function as a logic.

0. Looking back at this work some months later. We were using functions when we started, but have since moved on to representative abstractions. which have similar syntax but share neither the definition of a function nor the syntax.
1. Instead of evaluation, we express and abstract in rep logic, which in some cases, is isomorphic to function evaluation.
2. We will re-write the definitions in rep logic, then in the future, if called for, we may define and implement a function.
