![[Formal Command Syntax]]
![[Command Logic]]

PROP : CLGC : 2.1 : We establish the following gestures:
```
p1: POC = (1, 0)
p2: POC = (0, 1)
lit: Contact = (p1 : POC, p2: POC)

p1: POC = (2, 0)
p2: POC = (0, 1)
lmt: Contact = (p1 : POC, p2: POC)

p1: POC = (3, 0)
p2: POC = (0, 1)
lrt: Contact = (p1 : POC, p2: POC)

p1: POC = (4, 0)
p2: POC = (0, 1)
lpt: Contact = (p1 : POC, p2: POC)

p1: POC = (5, 0)
p2: POC = (9, 1)
rit: Contact = (p1 : POC, p2: POC)

p1: POC = (6, 0)
p2: POC = (9, 1)
rmt: Contact = (p1 : POC, p2: POC)

p1: POC = (7, 0)
p2: POC = (9, 1)
rrt: Contact = (p1 : POC, p2: POC)

p1: POC = (8, 0)
p2: POC = (9, 1)
rpt: Contact = (p1 : POC, p2: POC)
```

PROP : CLGC : 2.2 : We use these gestures in the following commands:
```
action: Contact = lit
expectation: general (user's choice)
source: SBE+
efficient: instantaneous

(lit, reticulate general ingratiation, SBE+, instantaneous)
```

```
action: Contact = ll
expectation: general (user's choice)
source: SBE+
efficient: instantaneous

(lit, reticulate general reticulation, SBE-, instantaneous)
```

```
action: Contact = lit
expectation: general (user's choice)
source: SBE+
efficient: instantaneous

(lit, reticulate general ingratiation, SBE+, instantaneous)
```

```
action: Contact = lmt
expectation: 'headache relief and aleartness'
source: SBE-
efficient: instantaneous
```

```
action: Contact = rit
expectation: 'gastro-ingratiation'
source: SBE-
efficient: instantaneous
```

PROP : CLGC : 2.3 : We shall establish the following commands for sexual ingratiation and reticulation:

```
action: Contact = rpt
expectation: sexual-reticulation
source: SBE+
efficient: instantaneous
```

```
action: Contact = lpt
expectation: sexual-ingratiation
	source: SBE-
efficient: instantaneous
```

PROP : CLGC : 2.4 : We implement the following command for gastro-reticulation:
```
action: Contact = lrt
expectation: gastro-reticulation
source: SBE
efficient: instantaneous
```

It is important to keep in mind these commands are completely arbitrary. The user evinces the causal relationship via the mechanism described in [[Mechanics of Evidence Generation]].

**Duration**
Given:
![[PROP-CLGC-0.6]]

PROP : CLGC : 2.5 : `x` is an abstraction of information describing our hand gesture.

PROP : CLGC : 2.6 : `y` is an abstraction of information describing an observation. In the [[Abstract Representative Calculus]], $f(x) \Rightarrow f(y)$.

PROP : CLGC : 2.7 : Given an abstraction of information, `x` we may represent the *meta-representation* as `Mr(x)`.

PROP : CLGC : 2.8 : Given an abstraction of information, `x` we may represent the *prima-representation* as `Pr(x)`.

PROP : CLGC : 2.9 : Every observed abstraction may be represented as a *meta-representation* of it's *prima-representation*.

PROP : CLGC : 3.0 : Given a command of the form `x -> y`, `(x := Pr(x)) ^ (x := Mr(x))`.

PROP : CLGC : 3.1 : Given the command: `(lit, general, SBE+, instantaneous)` we may substitute the actual hand-gesture for it's meta-representation, `lit`, implemented as a generative observation.

EX : CLGC : 3.2 : The user represents the code, `lit`, to trigger a hyper-spatial reticulation of `SBE`.

OBSD : CLGC : 3.3 : Tested with commands `lit` and `lrt`. The results were as expected. Immediate and significant.

PROP : CLGC : 3.4 : We desire the capability to maintain the state after submitting a command.

PROP : CLGC : 3.5 : We may establish a new command `toggle` that takes a command as input.

Given:
![[PROP-CLGC-0.6]]

PROP : CLGC : 3.6 : The command, `toggle`, de-constructs the command it takes as input and  introduces a piece of global state, `s`.

PROP : CLGC : 3.7 : Given the command, 

PROP : CLGC : 3.8 : When the `toggle` command is submitted, global state is toggled. with another command as input, the state is toggled.
