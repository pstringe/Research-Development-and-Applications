## Definition
*Given the assumption that observation is a dual concept involving both the generation of information and its discrimination. Magic is a method of resolving uncertainty via the generation of information as opposed to the discrimination of information.

## Method
Given our definition of magic, a method analogous to the scientific method can be utilized when we understand that the empirical evidence science is concerned with is both discriminated and generated. While the method of science resolves uncertainty via the discrimination of evidence, applying the scientific method in the context of magic would resolve uncertainty via the generation of evidence.

#### Observations / Problem / Question
One can select a problem they would like to solve, or a question they would like to resolve uncertainty about, based on discriminatory observations. Including empirical and phenomenological data

#### Assumptions
![[Typed Process Calculus Axioms]]

![[On the relationship between thought and being]]

#### Hypothesis
0. [prop] The subject is isomorphic to a process as defined in [Def 0] of [[Typed Process Calculus Axioms]] where `I` and `O` are isomorphic to the subject's representation of reality, and `M` is isomorphic to the thought of the model by which the subject resolves uncertainty or increases entropy.
1. [prop] The subject may formulate a hypothesis as a conditional statement of the form `p -> q`  where `p` is a statement and `q` is a state of affairs.
3. [prop] We may use a [[Hypothesis-H]] or a [[Hypothesis-R]]
4. [prop] In the context of magic, a hypothesis would be a proposition or a set of propositions meant to be accepted by a subject with the expectation that evidence will be generated that is consistent with the propositions.
5. [Def] *Evidation*: The evidation of a proposition is generation of information, which is interpreted as evidence supporting the truth of the proposition.
6. [Prop] A hypothesis in science places emphasis on the interpretation of evidence
7. [Prop] A hypothesis in magic places emphasis on the generation of evidence

#### Procedure
1. [prop oug] The procedure may be defined using a combination of propositions and imperatives.
2. [prop oug] One should take into account how to collect data 
3. [prop oug] One should determine the success criteria of the procedure before execution

#### Execution 
1. [prop ough] The conditions upon execution should be noted. 
2. [prop ough] If augmenting physiology, track anything that may effect the quality/quantity you are attempting to augment outside of your procedure.
