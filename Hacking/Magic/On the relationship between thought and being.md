## On the relationship between thought and being

A simple relationship between thought and being can be described using the process calculus.

Given the following theorem:
```
I ) M ) O
I ) M ) O   0
O.      O'. 1  Succession
```

0. [prop] Every observation involves both the generation and discrimination information
1. [prop] Accepting the following propositions increases the likelihood that subject will generate information it interprets as evidence consistent with the propositions.
2. [prop] The first `O` term is isomorphic to the generative aspect
3. [prop] The second `O` term is isomorphic to the discriminatory aspect.
4. [prop] The process model,  `M`, is isomorphic to the subject's representation of `M`.
5. [prop] The subject may be the represented process or another process.
6. [prop] ==Each succession resolves uncertainty of the observation, or increases entropy==(requires testing)
7. [prop] Assume the subject is the represented process.
8. [prop] We may represent `I` using a logical proposition.
9. [prop] That proposition may be `true`, `false` `accepted` or `rejected`.
10. [prop] If a proposition `P` is `true`, it is isomorphic to the state represented by `O`.
12. [prop] The acceptance of the proposition  `P`, augments `M` such that successive observations resolve `O` to a state that is isomorphic to `P`
