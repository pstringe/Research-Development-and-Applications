DEP : PL : 0.0 : [Positional Logic](Positional%20Logic.md)

PROP : PL : 0.1 : $(y\ |\  x)$ :$y$ occurs more often in the probability space than $y$.

PROP : PL : 0.1.1 : $(x\ |\ y)$ : $x$ occurs more often in space of probability than $y$.

PROP : PL : 0.2 : $(x = y)$ : x occurs as often in space as y.

PROP : PL : 0.3 : Likelihood : occurrences o**f x : items in the space.

PROP : PL : 0.4 : We develop a probability space by tracking the constraints we apply to a [possibility space](possibility%20space.md).

PROP : PL : 0.5 : Given a possibility space:

```
S = {
	00, 01
	10, 11	
}
```

where:
$$
((00=01) \land (00=10)) \land
((00=11) \land (01=10)) \land
((01=11) \land (10=11))
$$

PROP : PL : 0.6 : Given, the process $F := x_n\ )\ F\ )\ x_{n + 1}$ abiding by the [Epimenedes Paradox Constraint](Epimenedes%20Paradox%20Constraint.md), we

PROP : PL : 0.7 : Space of possible generations with 00 as an initial cause, we represent the space of possible generations:
