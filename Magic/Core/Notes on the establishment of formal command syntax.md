title: 				Notes on the establishment of formal command syntax
tags:
---
* It is important to note that every command must be representable on our NDC architecture. In that respect, it may be elucidated as an elucidated $thing$ abstraction in the [[Abstract Representative Calculus]] calculus. Or a $normal\ process$ in the process calculus
* In the case of commands which are elucidated, we are not concerned with any possibility/probability schema. So we can abstract that away. 
* Every command may be formulated as an imperative as described in BOE. 
* We may switch from imperatives to a request response model when dealing with alien entities. 
* Every imperative may be formulated as a proposition
* A proposition is a plurality of related abstractions
* We need to make a consideration of memory.
