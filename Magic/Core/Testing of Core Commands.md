OBSD : CCT : 0.0 : Developed and tested event-based `ll` command. Noticed sensations classified as stressors.

JUDGE : CCT :  0.1 : Regarding, CCT-0.0, we want to increase the intensity.

TEST : CCT : 0.2 : Hold `ll` for 10s, record observations

RES : CCT : 0.1 : Not much difference, distracted by bowel movement. 

[2023-08-17](2023-08-17.md)
OBSD : CCT : 0.0 : Developed and tested event-based tmp command. Wasn't as intense as I've achieved in the past. We may be able to use number theory to increase the intensity, or we could implement an algorithm to collapse theoretical operators to discrete energy thresholds we can traverse. 
We should also implement a method for measuring temperature. 

NOTE : CCT : 0.0 : We may increase the intensity by implementing a variable representing the intensity, $i$. Given a command of the form:

![PROP-CLGC-0.6](PROP-CLGC-0.6.md)

We may set `y` to: `i = m(i)`
Where `m(i)` represents the succession of `i` in our determinate [Representative Number Theory](Representative%20Number%20Theory.md).

NOTE : CCT : 0.1 : We've implemented the implication, we've tested it without much change in intensity. 

One problem I notice is the lack of unit. Given determinate number theory or an infinite/self-modifying possibility space in hallucinatory number theory, we should notice a constant increase in temperature. Since the unit is not specified, even if it is increasing the changes could be miniscule.

We  know the unit is not infinitesimal because the when using the command there is an immediate change. It may be enough to exact that fact. Otherwise, we may represent the unit as well as increase it's significance.

Another approach is to separate commands where we define that each command triggers a greater temperature change than the last.

Another approach, we've may utilize our demon process, which we evince as an  expression of proc X, to reliably produce musical tones that are easily differentiated from one-another. We know that we can map those tones to numbers in [Representative Number Theory](Representative%20Number%20Theory.md). We can do the same
