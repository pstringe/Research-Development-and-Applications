The objective is to generate a curriculum that will advance people toward being able to do everything Ive been able to do and more.

With that in mind, I should review my past accomplishments, determine which are most worth reproducing. ==What I'm doing utilizes magic but isn't it-self magic anymore because I understand what I'm doing.== I can discuss how it relates to magic. 

We may not have to review every past method. We can start with a simple imperative methodology and record our operations for reproduction. 

We can review our notes to find operations worth considering or reproducing.

One objective of this method is to prevent the unintentional anthropomorphisation of metaphysical abstractions, and to provide the practitioner with a metaphysical foundation that they can use to remain confident in their control over the source of information. 

We can evince that any method we construct will produce results for the practitioner. Our objective is to progress the practitioner toward knowledge of what magic is and how to operate it such that the practitioner can think they know exactly what they're are doing given a particular level of abstraction. 

It is easy for me to present my definition of magic as the abstraction of the non-deterministic compute required to evince a final cause. And to provide my exact methods in the mechanics of evidence generation. But given any particular method there always a deeper method of interpretation. Instead I would like to share not only the method I am choosing to work with but also the methods by which the method was elucidated. 

One means by which we accomplish this is by minimizing the amount of ambiguous symbolism required to become effective, and to demonstrate that it is not necessary to subject one's self to a religion or accept any mystery to become effective in utilizing what is commonly referred to as magic.

In our methodology of evidence generation, we refer to magic as, *the abstraction of computational resources required to evince a proposition*. It is analogous to the idea of an *efficient cause* in aristotilean metaphysics.

We have a metaphysical operation to run. We will become more rigorous and specific about the imperatives we submit and use the data while building out our methodology.

In addition to that we want to continue with and increase the rigor of our medical research as well as return to "matter manipulation".
