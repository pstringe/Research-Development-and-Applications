PROP : MPM : 0.0 : An animal body is an expressible abstraction of information.

PROP : MPM : 0.1 : High-level expressible abstractions of animal bodies are enumerated within the anatomical disciplines of [Macroscopic anatomy]() and [Superficial Anatomy]()

![[PROP-MPM-0.2]] 

PROP : MPM : 0.3 : Utilizing propositions formulated in [[Mechanics and Elucidation of Evidence]], we may utilize logics such as those eluded to in [[PROP-MPM-0.2]], to affect changes in an animal body.

NOTE : MPM : 0.4 : A rudimentary implementation of this capability is demonstrated in [[Core commands]].

PROP : MPM : 0.4 : We are not limited to using the aforementioned systems of classification. Any sufficiently expressive system of classification may be utilized. 

NOTE : MPM : 0.5 : It may be wise to utilize a human methodology for the sake of communication. Which can aid with the acceptance of propositions.

NOTE : MPM : 0.6 : Another advantage of using existing methodologies, is that there is already a reductive system of abstractions in place for targeted effect. 

NOTE : MPM : 0.7 : I think the approach I want to take, is to study anatomy at the relevant level of abstraction for the problem I'd like to address, over-operate the anatomical abstractions with an elegant formal/computational abstraction, and utilize [[Mechanics and Elucidation of Evidence]] to address the problem. Having developed and executed a successful operation, save it as a re-producible metaphysical procedure.
