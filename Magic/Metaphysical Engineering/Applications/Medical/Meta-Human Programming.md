![[Motivation for Meta-Human Programming]]

NOTE: P : 1.0 : There are three approaches to developing this meta-representation. We want the propositions we deal with to be relevant and fundamental. 

NOTE : P : 1.1 : Method 1: We may continue with our method of meticulously recording our imperative adjustments to process representation, noting the observation, the relevant sensory mediums, and anatomical region. Having collected this data, we can implement a space of relevant propositions, the possibility space of which will cover all of the situations. 

NOTE : P : 1.2 : Method 2 : We may start with relevant abstract propositions. For example: (region, sense, sign). See [[Possibility Spaces and Constraints]]

NOTE : P : 1.3 : Regarding 1.2, it may be preferable to use a non-binary value space such as in region, or sense.

NOTE : P : 1.4 : We may use a binary value space, we can use a 2d partition for each axis of a 3d state space. The orientation of the limbs matters.

NOTE : P : 1.3 : We may also use existing superficial anatomy charts
