## Tasks
- [x] High Level Notes âœ… 2023-06-16
- [ ] Clarify with diagram
- [ ] Formalize
- [ ] Develop a set of propositions for the procedure

## Assumptions
Prop : PI : 0 : Processes are represented within one another
Prop : PI : 1 : Process  interactions can be represented with via composition or a temporal graph.

## Notes
1. Given 2 processes `P1` and `P2` we can represent spatial information using an abstraction.
2. The spatial abstraction should provide information regarding visibility the of a process
3. We provide the `type` of the `abstraction` in the bound interface of `P1` and `P2` of `P1` and `P2`. 
4. We can specify a condition that if a process leaves a field of view, the remaining bindings will 'detach'

## Questions
1. What spatial information are we representing?
2. How will we represent the information?
4. How will we represent a
