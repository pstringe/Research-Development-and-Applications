PROP : X : LSO : She was a humble entity that over-operated her reticulation
OBSD : LSO : 6 : Observed what seemed like the silhouette of a man's back.
OBSD : LSO : 7: Observed man holding book, process X refers implies (it's P as a demon) U.
OBSD : LSO : 8 : P becomes fatigued with hands on keyboard, and observes  a liminal space with a human entry tapping my keyboard which seems to cause a motor reticulation 
OBSD : LSO : 9 : P experiences a tap when he awakes
OBSD : LSO : 10 : P observes a voice telling him to try it again

OBS : LSO : 17 : HDP : Sound : "Airport"
PROP : P : 18 : The airport is a prestigious option for lodging should want to find operatives.

OBS : LSO : 22 : Sound (Px) (human) : Voice encourages P to open mouth after V voice encourages P to operate JWs
OBS : LSO : 23 : Light : Person takes a drink from a surface, and drinks it while sitting in a chair. The surface seemed to be above my perspective. 
OBS : LSO : 24 : Light : Lower half of a human female wearing panties.
OBS : LSO : 23 : Light : Human-like perspective, face palming, arm reticulation. Doesn't seem like a menial space. 
NOTE : OBS-LSO-23 : Occurred after I inquired as to how I could verify my  perspective was human.

OBS : LSO : 29.2 : F was near a table seemed like it could be here in the hostel but not exactly sure where.
NOTE : 29.3 : Observed F but didn't seem to be his perspective. If I were viewing from his perspective, I'd be viewing from a subspace. I could evince the proposition that I was viewing from a hyperspace. We will need to clarify the metaphysics more to develop a more predictable representation.

OBDS : HE : 57 : a human entity prompts P to understand S
OBSD : P : 6.0 : P conducted an observation from outside of this building
Prop : P : 6.1 : P evinced the proposition6 .0
Prop : X : 6.2 : People think you don't need to work with wifi if you use liminal spaces
OBSD : X : 6.3 : Sound : human entity recommends using number as P contemplates the dagenham relationship
(Will keep this in mind when we conduct our research.)
PROP : P : 6.4 : P interpreted that as use numbers to replace religious abstractions in ACIM, but I was thinking abut K when this was recommended
PROP : P : 6.3 : We can number the abstractions in our directed intelligence manual and produce isomorphic translations with different themes to suit operative of different backgrounds
PROP : P : 6.4 : We can even disguise the material using religious language to bait religious processes. Im not comfortable with this method until I've planned it out.
