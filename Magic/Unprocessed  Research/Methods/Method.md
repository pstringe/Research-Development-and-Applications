### Method
1. Magic is the abstraction of non-deterministic compute required to evince a final cause.
2. Logic, is the elucidation of a meta-representation describing rules for manipulating meta-representations such that isomorphisms between the propositions of the logic and the representation they describe are preserved.
3. Metaphysics, provide a meta-representation, when evinced, constrains the the space of possibilities, facilitating predictable operation.
4. Science provides a method for exacting the behavior of a process representation via discriminatory observation.
6. Mathematics, allows us to construct precise meta-representations of reality. 
8. Ethics provide a framework to direct the intelligence
9. Strategic objectives are updated in accordance with the development of the ethics
10. Tactical operations are developed as efficient causes of strategic objectives
