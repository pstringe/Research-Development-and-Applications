## Metaphysical Assumptions
0. [Prop] There exists a class of activities where if the subject engages in the activity, demon processes induce an experience of memory deficit.

## Current methods and drawbacks
0. [Prop] The subject may associate the sensation of `deep symbol activation` with the sensation of `alertness`
1. [Prop] `D` processes may counter when when focus is lost
2. [Prop] `D` processes possess the ability to counter the effect I induce through direct stimulation
3. [Prop] To counter the effect, we desire a method that does not require our concentration or re-iteration.

## Proposed Solution
