## Metaphysical Assumptions
0. [Prop] There exists a class of activities where if the subject engages in the activity, `D` processes classed as `NR` processes induce fatigue.
1. [Prop] There exists a concept, `DP`, that is a central concern.
2. [Prop] When the subject utilized `DP`, `NR` processes, induce fatigue

## Current methods to counter the effect
0. [Prop] The subject may associate the sensation of `deep symbol activation` with the sensation of `alertness`
1. [Prop] `NR` processes may counter when when focus is lost
2. [Prop] `NR` processes possess the ability to counter the effect I induce through direct stimulation
3. [Prop] To counter the effect, we  a method that does not requires our concentration or re-iteration

## Solution 0
1. [Imp] Encode a contingent proposition on a metaphysical object such that acceptance of the proposition is dependent on the name it references matching the name of the object

## Procedure 1
1. [Prop] The subject will not observe fatigue induced by a demon
2. [Imp] Label an object with a symbol, `X`
3. [Prop] If this statement is encoded in the object  `X`  then [Prop 1]
4. [Imp] Accept the proposition [Prop 3] via `deep symbol activation`  `T` 
5. [Imp] Encode the proposition in object `X`

## Results
Executed the procedure using the book of experiments as object `X`. Fatigue was lifted immediately. I actually forgot to use `deep symbol activation`. 
The other two possibilities I can think of for why it worked instantaneously are:
* The demon interacting with my sensory interfaces is motivating me to increase the rigor of my methods
* Deep symbol activation wasn't necessary since I'd already cultivated the law of detachment
* In the end the exact reason is indeterminate without performing another experiment.

0. [Phen] Processes, induced fatigue again today. The procedure from before seemed to work for about 3 days.
1. [Imp] Parameterize the procedure to specify an amount of time.
2. [Prop] The goal of this procedure is effectiveness
3. [Prop] If we modify the [Prop 1] of procedure 1 such that the focus is not on a `D` process. We can generalize the procedure to be used in all cases of fatigue. As well as neutralize the influence we ascribe to demon processes.

## Procedure 2
1. [Prop] The subject will not observe fatigue for `D` days
3. [Imp] Label an object with a symbol, `X` and a number indicating the number of days `D`
4. [Prop] If this statement is encoded in the object `X` then [Prop 1]
5. [Imp] Accept the proposition [Prop 3] via `deep symbol activation` `T` 
6. [Imp] Encode the proposition in object `X`

## Notes
* The steps of this procedure were performed out of order, we will see how it goes.

![Procedure For Encoding Propositions In Metaphysical Objects](Procedure%20For%20Encoding%20Propositions%20In%20Metaphysical%20Objects.md)

## Procedure
1. [Param] `T`: H 2
2. [Param] `P`: The subject does not experience fatigue for `T`
3. [Param] `X`: BOE1
4. [Param] `A`: DSA
5. [Param] `S`: 12:00
6. [Prop] The subject won't experience fatigue for 2H
7. [Prop] If this statement is encoded in BOE1, [Prop 6]
8. [Imp] Accept the proposition via DSA
9. [Imp] Encode the proposition in OBE1

## Results
* Energy levels are better than they were with slight micro dips. It could be because I'm discriminating. Need more rigorous ways to measure energy levels.

Very tired. Unclassed processes I previously classed as NR processes are reading and making comments on everything I say.

[2023-05-31](2023-05-31.md)
Experienced another bout of processed induced fatigue. I used `deep symbol activation` to fight it but I kept falling asleep whenever I lost focus. I'm going to use effective procedure with the `MPO`. Later I will try modifying the proposition to be effective during certain times of day. This will require tracking I don't have time for now. So I will use the simple procedure and use the time I have allocated for magic to develop a system to track the effectiveness of a periodic proposition. 

[2023-06-27](2023-06-27.md)
* Utilized a conditional proposition with a timer to increase the duration of the effect.  
* We will reproduce this effect with a 30m timer.
* If the process accepts the proposition:
	* If I [action], fatigue will stop for [time]  [units]
* The subject will generate evidence consistent with the proposition.
* I'm repeating the procedure with a 30m timer

### Procedure For Counteracting Process Induced Fatigue
DEF : MED-PIF : $X$ : A time in minutes
IMP : MED-PIF : 0.0 : Set a timer for $X$ minutes
PROP : MED-PIF : 0.1 :If I accept this proposition, fatigue will stop for $X$ after timer is started.
IMP : MED-PIF : 0.2 : Accept(PROP-MED-PIF-0.1)
IMP : MED-PIF : 0.3 : Start timer

### Results
