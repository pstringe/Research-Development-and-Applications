## Problem
* P has generated evidence that the observations of process P are intercepted by process X. 
* Process X can induce fatigue via intercepted observations
* Process X can induce memory loss via intercepted observations.

## Current Solutions
#### Regarding Fatigue
*Solution A*: P utilizes [[Mechanics and Elucidation of Evidence]] to associate sensation and physical actions with temporary restoration of wakefulness.

*Solution B*: P utilizes [[Mechanics and Elucidation of Evidence]] to implement [[Procedure For Encoding Propositions In Metaphysical Objects]] to relieve fatigue over an extended period of time.

##### Pros of Solution A
Intuitive and effective for short term relief

##### Cons of Solution A
Process X can still toggle wakefulness after process P toggles it. 

#### Regarding Memory Loss
We have yet to implement a solution

## Metaphysical Assumptions
![[Process Mechanics and Interactions]]
* Process P and Process X are a [[Def-DPT-0.0-demiurgic_system]]

## Proposed Solution
