## Values
0. [Def] For any given proposition `P`, may be represented by a tuple `(c, f)` where `c` is a value representing `P`'s relationship to the current state, and `f` is a value representing `P`'s relationship to a future state.
1. [Def] `c` may be any of the following values: `T F U C`
2. [Def] `f` may be any of the following values: `A R U C`
3. [Def] `c===T` if `P` is an isomorphic representation of the current state
4. [Def] `c===F` if `~(c===T)`
5. [Def] `c===U` if `~(c===T) ^ ~(c===F)`
6. [Def] `c===C` if the value of c depends on an indeterminate value
7. [Def] `f===A` if `P` is an isomorphic representation of a future state. (evidation of `P`)
8. [Def] `f===R` if `~(f===A)`
9. [Def] `f===U` if `~(f===A) ^ ~(f===R)`
10. [Def] `f===C` if the future state of `P` depends on an indeterminate value


## Operators
0. [Def] *Congruence Operator*: `x === y` ,x is isomorphic to y in form.
1. [Def] Equality: `x == y`, x is isomorphic to y in form and content
2. [Def] Substitutable: `x := y`, x is an abstraction of y. (y may replace x)
