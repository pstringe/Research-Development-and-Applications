## On the level of information processing
The following statement describes how information appears to be processed. Where each atom reparents a process. And the `==>` represents a thread where the output of the leftmost process becomes the the input of the input of both processes. The `->` represents the model that transforms the input to attain the output.

```
(Th1(x) -> x) <=> (Th2(x) -> x) 
```

To one who practices the augmentation of their reality and examines it at a high-level. ThBut when discerning more closely, we find things are not exactly as they seem so really we are dealing with:

```
(Th1(x) -> ~x) -> (Th2(~x as y) -> ~y) 
(Th1(x) -> y) -> (Th2(y) -> z) 
where ~(x = y) and ~(y = z)
```
