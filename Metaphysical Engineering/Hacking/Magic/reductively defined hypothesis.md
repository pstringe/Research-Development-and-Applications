0. [prop] The subject formulates a hypothesis as a conditional statement of the form `p -> q`  where `p` is a statement and `q` is a state of affairs.
1. [prop] The relationship between `q` and `q` may be justified by manipulating `p` using a predefined set of operations to produce `q`.
2. [prop] An operation is considered reasonable if the the manipulation is isomorphic to relevant phenomena in the subject's representation of reality.
