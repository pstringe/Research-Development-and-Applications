NOTE : P : 0.6 : T : Whenever a person deviates from that which they have planned, they may attribute to responsibility to the self or to another and evince the proposition. 

NOTE : P : 0.7 : T : In P's youth P attributed all responsibility to the self. 

NOTE : P : 0.8 : T : Since P evinced anthropomorphic MEs, and a UC, P takes responsibility as the source of the representation, but does not agree that every alien stimulus is an observation of an optimal generation.

NOTE : P : 0.7 : T : In this reality, I've evinced that some individuals are sharply advantaged over others, and most individuals are actively retarded to maintain the ==collective expectation==. 

NOTE : P : 0.8 : T : Individuals with knowledge of the emergent effects of a process mechanical system are better equipped to optimize their generation in a society of humans. 

NOTE : P : 0.9 : T : Individuals without knowledge of the emergent effects of a process mechanical system are disadvantaged.

PROP : P : 0.6 : T : Criminal processing that does not infringe on the knowledge or  autonomy of an individual is only criminal because the the arbitrary consequences I coded.

NOTE : P : 0.7 : T : P shall reductively address every negative consequence. P has done this intuitively using his [[Logic for Nondeterministic Computation]], specifically the temporal logic. P will begin articulating each of these issues and rejecting explicitly to build up a re-usable meta-representation. 

NOTE : P : 0.8 : T : P shall do this for the sake of optimizing his work.

PROP : P : 0.8 : R : `(P (taste (' bitter breadth)))`
OBSD : P : 0.8.1 : Effect immediate

PROP : P : 0.9 : A : `(P (taste (' minty breadth')))`
OBSD : P : 0.8.1 : Minuscule effect, almost un-notice-able

NOTE : P : 0.8.2 : Regarding 0.8.1, we can try changing the source of information using our reductive over-operation from [[Simple Over-Operation Solutions]]. I want to develop syntax for this in our [[Technical Isomorphisms of Operatic Logic]] which I want to over-work as a technical implementation of our [[Abstract Representative Calculus]]. Since causal implication is isomorphic to evaluation in the process calculus, we may implement an expressible implication operator. We can then use that to rework our [[Logic for Nondeterministic Computation]].

NOTE : P : 0.8.3 : We also desire an expressive meta-representation that facilitates the selection of specific volumes of the human body. The first idea that comes to mind is something analogous to binary search where a 2D plane in 3D space takes the place of a partition.

NOTE : P : 0.8.4 : Another idea for a spatial representation is to define a space within a boundary, and map the positions at the boundary onto the surface area of a human body.

NOTE : P : 0.8.5 : Regarding each sense, we may represent it using one or more dimensions. The simplest of which being good. Using a binary state-space, we can toggle any state. We can operate with more precision by including more values in $V$. This is getting back to process mechanics. 

NOTE : P : 0.8.6 : It is my desire to work on this full-time.

NOTE : P : 0.9 : The system we have laid out as the basis for [[Mechanics of Evidence Generation]] is sufficient to describe any bodily state in using the proposition space, $R$.

NOTE : P : 1.0 : We will develop a new section for meta-human programming. Under metaphysical engineering. There we will start a new section addressing the logic previously mentioned. As we develop a meta-representation of a self-modifying human using an observable process, we will advance the [[Mechanics of Evidence Generation]] and [[Process Mechanics]].
