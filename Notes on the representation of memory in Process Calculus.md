Notes on the representation of memory in Process Calculus: 
* The concept of memory is related to the concept of elucidation.
* A memory seems to be a liminal observation that may be triggered by certain other observations. 
* The trigger may be internal or external.
* We can associate a memorable abstraction of information with a reference abstraction to reliably retrieve it.
* We consider the retrieval to take place over a generation.
* Memory on the NDC is indeterminate as propositions are indeterminate as demonstrated in [Reductive demonstration of indeterminacy of abstract propositions](Reductive%20demonstration%20of%20indeterminacy%20of%20abstract%20propositions.md)
* We may constrain the space of generations that would satisfy the final cause by expressing the abstracted plurality of propositions. 
* We require the ability to association and dissociate observations
