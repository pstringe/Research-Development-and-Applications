### Process Interactions Manuscript from (Representation of 2 processes)
* In our manuscript we refer to the edge abstraction as a compound recursive edge. My concern is, that this may be redundant. By compound I mean an abstraction of things that are discriminated as consisting of multiple abstractions at the same level of abstraction.  
* An abstraction is recursive if the things it abstracts includes the abstraction.
* We assume that each bound abstraction is a compound abstraction. 
* A compound abstraction may be recursive but not necessarily  
* In the case of the untyped process calculus, the bindings of a compound edge relate the expressed abstractions of  a process' output abstraction to the expressed abstractions a process' input abstraction
* In the case of the typed process calculus, the form of the expression of input and output abstractions are declared as an interface

### Notes on [[Def-TC-0.1.2-abstraction]]
* Here we use the term symbol. We've already associated the term `symbol` with the idea of a symbol from semiotics, consisting of a sign and signified, it can be argued this also meets our definition of abstraction. 
* We don't need to crowd our method with terminology
* We know that our representation is infinitely recursive, though we want to represent what we are talking about.
* I seem to be confusing form with representation. We can leave out the term symbol. That we refer to each abstraction by an identifier of some sort is implicit.
* I seem to have been tempted to include a symbol in the definition because I was concerned with how I would implement a technical simulation.
* If we are trying to capture the idea elegantly we don't need to use symbol.
* right now, using object like type definitions is somewhat confusing
* We can switch to a functional abstraction since we are trying to represent a concept we originally thought of functional. 
* We can use object like syntax for interpretation of functional abstractions.
