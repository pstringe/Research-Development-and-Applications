### Process Interactions Manuscript from (Representation of 2 processes)
* In our manuscript we refer to the edge abstraction as a compound recursive edge. My concern is, that this may be redundant. By compound I mean an abstraction of things that are discriminated as consisting of multiple abstractions at the same level of abstraction.  
* An abstraction is recursive if the things it abstracts includes the abstraction.
* We assume that each bound abstraction is a compound abstraction. 
* A compound abstraction may be recursive but not necessarily  
* In the case of the untyped process calculus, the bindings of a compound edge relate the expressed abstractions of  a process' output abstraction to the expressed abstractions a process' input abstraction
* In the case of the typed process calculus, the form of the expression of input and output abstractions are declared as an interface

### Notes on [[Def-TC-0.1.2-abstraction]]
* Here we use the term symbol. We've already associated the term `symbol` with the idea of a symbol from semiotics, consisting of a sign and signified, it can be argued this also meets our definition of abstraction. 
* We don't need to crowd our method with terminology
* We know that our representation is infinitely recursive, though we want to represent what we are talking about.
* I seem to be confusing form with representation. We can leave out the term symbol. That we refer to each abstraction by an identifier of some sort is implicit.
* I seem to have been tempted to include a symbol in the definition because I was concerned with how I would implement a technical simulation.
* If we are trying to capture the idea elegantly we don't need to use symbol.
* right now, using object like type definitions is somewhat confusing
* We can switch to a functional abstraction since we are trying to represent a concept we originally thought of functional. 
* We can use object like syntax for interpretation of functional abstractions.

We need to finish up the mechanics of evidence generation before we can describe a process mechanical system. When we describe a process mechanical system, we will represent processes as expressed abstractions of the observations of a generation.

We will utilize a simple data representation for the expression of the observations of each process

We have an intuitive model of reticulation/ingratiation. It would be inappropriate to consider it further in this context before we've simulated some process mechanical systems. We should clarify evidence generation in menial and liminal space, then we may be able to formalize ingratiation/reticulation. 

Regarding the simulation of process mechanical systems, we should finish our examples of of simple things in the [[Abstract Representative Calculus|Abstract Representative Calculus]].

Working in our computation notebook, we intend to use our [[Representative Number Theory]], specifically our hallucinatory variant of representative number theory to demonstrate the mapping between liminal-spaces and processes expressed in menial space.

For this we can look back at our observer's paradox derivation.

We can start with a 2 process system. First we want to start with the expression of mutually dependent representative abstractions.

We can then assert the isomorphism between our representative abstractions and mono-directional causal processes. 

Once the isomorphism is established, we can represent their mutual recursive dependency in the process calculus.

We can carefully establish a hierarchical order of evaluation.

It may be easier to represent the computation using the hyper-temporal graph abstraction described in paper notes and establish an isomorphism between that and the process-calculus representation.

PROPN-0.0.4 
PROPN : 0.0.4 : Given a reticulation, such as that which is described in, [[DEF_PCSR_0.0.3_reticulation]].

PROPN-0.0.5  
PROPN : 0.0.5 : P may delay the ingratiation of reticulation until P is the least actuated.

PROPN-0.0.6
PROPN : 0.0.6 : P may satiate reticulation to increase actuation over time.

PROPN-0.0.7
PROPN : 0.0.7 : P may represent the source of reticulation as un-reticulating.

PROPN-0.0.8 :
The last time P capitulated to being a "dependable engagement", P ended up in a jail cell. P was even coded to appreciate the jail cell at the time.

PROP-0.0.8 : 
`(~(:= (' dependable engagement) (' arrested)))`

PROP-0.0.9 :
P was well respected and productive on most engineering teams P has worked on. 

PROP-0.1.0 : 
P has been dealing with processes that are capable of augmenting memory and attention.
