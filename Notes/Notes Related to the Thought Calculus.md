Prop : NRTC : 0.0 : Time is a resolution to the seeming contradiction of [[Axiom-TC-0.1-GD]] and [[Axiom-TC-0.2-EP]].

* one way to address the conflict is to elaborate on the meaning of $=$.
* currently we use = to mean 3 things:
	* one thing/thought (abstraction) is substitutable for another (:=)
	* two abstractions are not distinguishable (=)
	* the evaluation of one a abstraction is not distinguishable from another abstraction (=>)
* evaluation implies a succession

* where f is the abstraction of this:
* this is what it is
* f=f
* this is not what it is
* f != f 
* this is not the thing it thinks it is
* ~(f(f) = f)
* this is not the thing it thought it was
* ~(f(f) => f) or
* where S is the space of possibilities
* f(f) => x where ~(x = f)

[[2023-07-24]]
* Originally we interpret the f(x) as f thinks of x
* We need to think about how liminal observations are related to menial observations
* We want to see if we can represent this in the abstract calculus
* At pelican we differentiated between imaginary and real observations
* It is possible to generate imaginary and real stimuli simultaneously
* We need to differentiate between s

JUDGE : 0.0 : [[Axiom-TC-0.1-GD]] , [[Axiom-TC-0.2-EP]], express the abstraction of equality some concepts that can be clarified
	* equality of form
	* equality of value
	* equality of reference
	* evaluation (mono-directional a-temporal reference equality)
	* classification
