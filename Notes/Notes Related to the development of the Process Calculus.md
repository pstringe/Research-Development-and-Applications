0. We removed typed interface from the process calculus when we formalized our abstractions.
1. We may want to use interfaces with process representation.

NOTE : 0.0 : We've established the $selector$ responsible for the $elucidation$ of an observation, is representable be the process constrained by the observation.
```
(P
	(=
		(C_e P)
		(selector P)
	)
)

(P
	(=
		(C_i (selector P))
		P
	)
)
```
