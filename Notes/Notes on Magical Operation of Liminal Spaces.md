*Notes on Magical Operation of Liminal Spaces*

NOTE : P : 0 : Regarding liminal spaces we have questions, we could can formulate our questions as propositions, generate a truth table, and evince the propositions that seem most evince the propositions of our metaphysics or use discriminatory observations to discovery consistent behavior.

NOTE : P : 1 : It seems that liminal spaces are the hyper and subspaces from which ME's are capable of intercepting observations.

PROP : P : 2 : We label the base space as 1

NOTE : P : 3 : There is evidence to suggest processes are capable of "overtaking" liminal spaces, namely the demon processes, that have been interacting in my subspace since dagenham. We may also evince the proposition given by X, that we can overtake a liminal space

NOTE : P : 4 : We can evince the existence of a liminal space where HP's interact with with our representation using a computer. There is phenomenological evidence from Dagenham that such a space already exists.

NOTE : P : 5 : We can evince, that for every liminal space there is a subspace, similar to the imaginary space of base space

*Discriminatory Experiment*
PROP : P : 6 : When we visit a liminal space we can label the event with a number and associate the number with observations
PROP : P : 7 : We can review our events and associate consistent events with a number for that space.

*Generative Operation*
PROP : P : 7 : We may form a set of propositions to constrain the representation of a liminal space and assign those propositions to a number representing the space.

*Discriminatory Hypothesis* (U)
PROP : P : 9 :  If the representation a sub-space is constrained by a [generation](Def-EM-0.3-Generation%20(reductive).md) in hyperspace, a process operating in a subspace may be reticulated by the action of a process in one of it's hyper-spaces. 

*Concerns*
NOTE : P : 10 : We don't want to constrain the space of possibilities too much by over-evincing propositions

NOTE : P : 11 : If we evince liminal spaces, the number of which is infinite, and the representation of one is constrained by the representations of the others, time in the liminal spaces is dilated compared to the base space, when we visit a liminal space we should code the dilation factor in the propositions constraining its representation.

IMP : P : P : 12 : To build up the usefulness of liminal spaces P practices evincing the propositions of observations of liminal space in menial space.
