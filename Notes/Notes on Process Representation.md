PROP : NPR : 1. We consider the sensory information of the observed term to be the thing's representation of itself

The thing's representation is not isomorphic to the thing

The thing cannot be observed only evinced by observation

0. With regard to liminal spaces, the spaces upon which the generation of the observation are dependent, are always beyond observation. 
1. That which is beyond observation is metaphysical
2. The metaphysical can be represented and the abstractions of the representation, manipulated, for effect in the physical (that which is observable).

PROP : P : BOE : 130 : 930 : Generative background observations are often classified as imaginary
PROP : P : BOE : 130 : 931 : Generative foreground observations are often classified as manipulative (magical)
PROP : P : BOE : 130 : 932 : Discriminatory foreground observations are often classified as real.

PROP : NPR : 1.0 :  Given a process, $x_0\  ) f )\  y_0$, $x$ and $y$ are abstractions information.

PROP : NPR : 1.0.1: Given $x_0\ ) f )\ y_0$, $x_0\ )\ x_0\ )\ f\ )\ y_{0-1})\ y_0$ is valid

PROP : NPR : 1.1 : Given the observation of $f$, $y ) x ) f ) y$, the observed $abstraction$, $y$ is an $abstraction$ of information information representing the $thing$ $f$.

NOTE : We should clarify the nature of the non-deterministic computation of f as a source of information so we can formally clarify examples of process representation.

Currently or evidence generation mechanics only express the operation of menial space. But we know there is at least one liminal space we tend to refer to as mental or imaginary. The space of thought, which is able to directly influence menial space, via the body, or via other means with skill. 

Our composable hype-point abstractions is, currently, little better than a visual analogue for [Axiom-TC-0.1-GD](Axiom-TC-0.1-GD.md). We should clarify the nature of the none deterministic computation in the thought calculus before we extrapolate to the process calculus.

Liminal spaces not only justify our observations, but also present a solution to scarcity

PROP : NPR : 1.0 : The observation of f is it's own dependency (EV)

PROP : NPR : 2.0 : There are at least 2 liminal spaces (real, and imaginary) (EV)

PROP : NPR : 3.0 : A "boundary/nexus" may be expressed as a set of liminal spaces (EV)

PROP : NPR : 4.0 : There are a potentially infinite number of liminal spaces, (expressible) (EV)

PROP : NPR : 5.0 : The observations of any particular space, are dependent on its sub-spaces, and hyper-spaces (EV)

PROP : NPR : 6.0 : The observations of any particular space reticulate it's liminal spaces insofar as they are manipulative (EV)

PROP : NPR : 6.1 : The observations of any particular space ingratiate its liminal spaces insofar as they are adaptive (EV)

PROP : NPR : 6.2 : reticulation/ingratiation may be directional (EV)
