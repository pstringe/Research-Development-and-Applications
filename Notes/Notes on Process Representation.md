Given a process, $x ) f ) y$, $x$ and $y$ are abstractions of sensory information.

Given the observation of $f$, $y ) x ) f ) y$ the observed $abstraction$, $y$ is an $abstraction$ of the $thought$ $abstraction$ of the sensory representation[^1] of the $thing$  $f$.

The observed term, $y$, is the abstraction of information encoded within a $hyperpoint$

We consider the sensory information of the observed term to be the thing's representation of itself

The thing's representation is not isomorphic to the thing

The thing cannot be observed only evinced over a succession of observations.
