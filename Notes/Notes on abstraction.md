title: 				Notes on abstraction

 Currently we have two definitions of abstraction
 ![[Def-TCP-0.1.2-abstraction]]
 and
 ![[Def-NLA-1.0-Abstraction]]
The first definition was formulated while developing the Typed Process Calculus, which is now, just the process calculus. The first definition was intended to be formal, the second, a technical definition which defines an evaluator for a natural language abstraction. 

One problem I have with the first abstraction is the use of symbol within the definition which requires further definition. I think the definition would be similar to abstraction if not the same so it seems redundant. A symbol could be useful in a technical specification, to define a representative signature, but seems unnecessary in a formal definition.
