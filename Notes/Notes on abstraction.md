 Currently we have two definitions of abstraction
 ![[Def-TC-0.1.2-abstraction]]and
 ![[Def-NLA-1.0-Abstraction]]
The first definition was formulated while developing the Typed Process Calculus, which is now, just the process calculus. The first definition was intended to be formal, the second, a technical definition which defines an evaluator for a natural language abstraction. 

One problem I have with the first abstraction is the use of symbol within the definition which requires further definition. I think the definition would be similar to abstraction if not the same so it seems redundant. A symbol could be useful in a technical specification, to define a representative signature, but seems unnecessary in a formal definition.

After further evaluation, I think it is better to work with thoughts and things since they can easily be represented using functional abstractions and process abstractions.

Something that came to mind is the notion of replacing abstraction with thought / thing. A thing, being a thing that can be thought of, For instance, we can have a thing, $f$ of a thought, $f()$ 

[[2023-06-21]]
Before we defined abstraction recursively as an association between an abstraction and one or more abstractions of information. We recently redefined it to make use of the terminology we defined in our functional thought calculus.

We've temporarily removed the concept of information but will return to it as we develop process mechanics and representation. 

The concept we want to get though is the inaccessibility of $things$ and the idea that we can only observe the information they process. 

A thing is ==exactly== what you think it is thought is always encoded as information.

We will define what we mean by, ==exactly==, since this is important in our [[Mechanics and Elucidation of Evidence]] when referring to the resolution of uncertainty.
