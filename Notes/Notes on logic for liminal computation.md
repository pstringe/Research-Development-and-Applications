NOTE: I would like to clarify what a logic is and what propositions are in [Mechanics and Elucidation of Evidence](Mechanics%20and%20Elucidation%20of%20Evidence.md) before updating the definitions here.

NOTE : One of my concerns is our current definition of an indeterminate value which was sufficient when learning to train a demon but but may not be sufficient to relate indeterminacy to the concept of potentiality. The question which activated this train of thought is:

Does an indeterminate value mean the proposition is/has none of its possible values or all of them?
