Prop : BOE : 37.148 : We consider a belief to be true when the symbols of the meta-representation are isomorphic to the base representation

NOTE : BOE : 0.1 : A thing is evinced by its representation.

NOTE : BOE : 0.2 : A thing's representation is the is the result of the recursive evaluation of observation.

NOTE : BOE : 0.3 : A meta-representation of reality is delusional if its abstractions are not isomorphic to it's base representation.

NOTE : BOE : 0.4 : A meta-representation is illusory if the base-representation is impossible

NOTE : BOE : 0.5 : All representations are either meta-representations, or illusory.

NOTE : BOE : 0.6 : If an observation in the process calculus is interpreted as a meta-representation of the previous observation, it is possible to delude the process

NOTE : BOE : 0.7 : A 

PROP : BOE : 0.6 : If it is what it thinks it is, it is a deluded entity U

PROP : BOE : 0.7 : If it is what it is, it is an illusory entity U


1. A proposition consists of abstractions
2. A proposition is a [thing](Def-TC-0.0-thing.md).
3. A thing may be represented by a functional abstraction.
4. 'A proposition references itself' is isomorphic to 'A function is dependent on itself'. [[2023-06-29]]
