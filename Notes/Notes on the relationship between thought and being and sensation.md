**On the relationship between thought and being**
Prop : RTB : 0.0 : thoughts and things are abstractions of information (T)

Prop : RTB : 0.1 : thoughts are observed in subspace relative to base space (U)

Prop : BOE : 128 : 930 : generative background observations are often classified as imaginary

Prop : BOE : 128 : 931 : generative foreground observations are often classified as magical

PROP : BOE : 128 : 932 : discriminatory foreground observations are often classified as real

**Formalization using  hyper-point, thing isomorphism**

A simple relationship between thought and being can be described using the process calculus.

Given the following theorem:
```
I ) M ) O
I ) M ) O   0
O.      O'. 1  Succession
```

PROP : RTB : 0.0 :  Every observation involves both the generation and discrimination information.

PROP : RTB : 0.1 : Accepting the following propositions increases the likelihood that subject will generate information it interprets as evidence consistent with the propositions.

PROP : RTB : 0.2 : The first `O` term is isomorphic to the generative aspect

PROP : RTB : 0.3 : The second `O` term is isomorphic to the discriminatory aspect

PROP : RTB : 0.4 : The process,  `M`, is isomorphic to the `M` representation of `M`.
```
I ) M ) O == I ) I ) M ) O ) O
```

* We may interpret the act of observation as delusion when observations are not isomorphic to their succeeding observations.
