* In our manuscript we refer to the edge abstraction as a compound recursive edge. My concern is, that this may be redundant. By compound I mean an abstraction of things that are discriminated as consisting of multiple abstractions at the same level of abstraction.  
* An abstraction is recursive it the things it abstracts includes the abstraction.
* We assume that each bound abstraction is a compound abstraction. 
* A compound abstraction may be recursive but not necessarily  
* In the case of the untyped process calculus, the bindings of a compound edge relate the expressed abstractions of  a process' output abstraction to the expressed abstractions a process' input abstraction
* In the case of the typed process calculus, the form of the expression of input and output abstractions are declared as an interface
