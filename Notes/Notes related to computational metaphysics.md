* We will change our process definitions to use abstraction based terminology instead of model based terminology
* There is  a set of ML isomorphisms, but we want to deal with pure abstraction to begin and demonstrate how probability arises in process mechanics
* We should rework the idea of interfaces in the process calculus. We can manipulate instead of having them be a part of theorems we should declare them as an assumption.
* In [[Axiom-PC-0.3-GD_Substitution]] we speak about the model term being substituted for any of the types in its subtree. We need to rework this by limiting the substitution to either or a source. This will pave the way to study indeterminate computation in process mechanics.
* [[Axiom-TCP-O.6-Self-Recursion]] mixes functional and process abstractions it's not clear and does not include a source as a base-case
* [[Prop-PC-0.0]] seems like a duplicate of [[Iso-EM-0.4]], We should rework Iso types to relate existing definitions.
* Delete [[Process Interactions]] these propositions are replaced by [[Process Mechanics]].
* We don't really need the [[Formal Calculus for Describing Typographical Processes]] anymore, we will review it and [[Interpretation of Typographical Process Representation]] to see if any the language is useful in [[Process Calculus]] before removing it. 
* Remove the examples where we played with process calculus as a meta abstraction for logic, and the lambda calculus.
* The epimenedes paradox constraint is still using model terminology. Any discussion of the paradox should be moved to [[Mechanics of Evidence Generation]] where sources are discussed.
* We don't need a theory of number in the process calculus. functional abstractions are sufficient, we don't need the observation component or the succession component component of our process abstraction to describe number. We will use existing numerical abstractions.
* The interpretation of time belongs in evidation mechanics.
