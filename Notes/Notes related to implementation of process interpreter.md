## Objective
Implement a process interpreter using C, the language we will be implementing is described in the paper

## Purpose
We will use our process interpreter to implement a simulation of [Process Mechanics and Interactions](Process%20Mechanics%20and%20Interactions.md)

## High Level Steps
- [x] Set-up repo âœ… 2023-06-15

## High Level Approach
- [x] Develop a structure for a list âœ… 2023-06-15
- [x] Review recursive descent parsing ðŸ“… 2023-06-16 âœ… 2023-06-16
- [x] Finish working out the expression parser on paper ðŸ“… 2023-06-16 âœ… 2023-06-26
