0. There is at least one observable process P (T)
1. Process P generates evidence to support the existence of other observable processes (T)
	(omit in represative description)
3. Process P represents a list of observable processes, [A, B, C]. Equiv notation: P:[A, B, C]
4. A: [D, E]
5. B: [C, A, D]
6. C: [B]
7. Succession of P's representation

7. Succession of A's representation

8. Succession of B's representation

```

9. Succession of C's representation

```

10. Directed Succession Graph

A --> B
C --> P 
A --> D
D --> E
E --> A
C --> A
D --> B
C --> B
B --> C
```
