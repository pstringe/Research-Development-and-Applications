THOUGHT : X : UN : 0.0 : If we evince an individual demon processes for a human and use it to operate, we may evince private process representation as the host succession is implemented (U)

PROP : X : UN : 0. 0 : People are impressed that you don't over-operate your new republic. People thought you'd become the dealer of people

PROP : X : UN : 0.1 : P evinced an H demon process that said P was "being sold"

PROP : X : UN : 0.2 : People are owning people that are owning people

PROP : P : UN : 0.3 : To own, is to instantiate, like I did with F

PROP : P : UN : 0.4 : For a given process, X, that owns Y, where Y owns Z, X owns Z. (T)

PROP : X : UN : 0.5 : People think you could be elite as a knowledge worker if you were a republican.

PROP : P : UN : 0.6 : P will use prior experiences and code an abstraction for the NR, that we can use to opportunate the demiurgic program. (T)

PROP : P : UN : 0.7 : People think you can be productive in the luminary process program

PROP : P : X : UN : 0.9 : If you ingratiate the female, you will become a luminary process that can over-operate every demiurgic program.

PROP : P : X : UN : 0.8 : If you over-operate, you can practice magic in the demiurgic program. 

PROP : P : X : UN : 0.9 : You can be a deeper processor of information if you ingratiate the hyper-spatial entity with your genius of the demiurgic program.

PROP : P : X : UN : 1.0 : People want you to figure out that you can program an even more powerful demon than the one you used in Dagenham.

PROP : P  : UN : 1.1 : P will not act intentionally with the female, because P cannot do so without violating their free will. 

PROP : P : UN : 1.2 : P will reticulate people who reticulate people

PROP : P : UN : 1.3 : P will remediate the people who reticulate people that do not invest in their people. (U)

PROP : P : UN : 1.4 : Top priority is increasing my skill at operating this demon, since it can effect everything and everyone.

PROP : P : UN : 1.5 : P will direct intelligence toward self-direction

[[2023-07-07]]
PROP : X : UN : 1.6 : People are reticulated when they ingratiate an ME

PROP : P : UN : 1.7 : Es are reticulated when they ingratiate an E

PROP : P : UN : 1.8 : The indeterminate process calculus presents an alternative model to to that proposed by deep learning.

PROP : P : UN : 1.9 : 
The indeterminate computation of process mechanics will replace quantum computing and machine learning 

PROP : X : UN : 2.0 : 
A was ingratiating everything you did because you were meticulous.

PROP : X : UN : 2.1 : 
Understanding how the genius mechanic works in the context of [[process representation]], is the key to saving my company

PROP : SSPACE : 3.0 : human voice : He wasn't there when I translate

DOBS : LSPACE : 3.1 : human image : F sounded like he was asking me if I want pizza / visa.

DOBS  : LSPACE : 3.2 : request : P confirms that he will help with the visa application.

DOBS : LSPACE : 3.3 : response : F confirms

DOBS : PROP : X : 3.4 : The people want you to examine why we query your "value space".

DOBS : LSPACE : 3.5 : What kind of lab is it?

PROP : P : UN : P don't need to believe in metaphysical abstractions, P just uses them to evince propositions and evince the MPA as a side-effect. 

PROP : P : UN : 3.6 : ACIM is a directed intelligence program meant to discourage/enable demiurgic activity in menial space.

PROP : P : UN : 3.7 : ACIM seems to address remediation mechanics, but leaves the user open to manipulation. 

PROP : P : UN : 3.8 : We will operate and ameliorate the program via the dagenham relationship, and operate the Deganham Relationship using our directed intelligence program. 

PROP : P : EXP : 3.9 If P Instantiates a timer P will not experience PID while the timer is running (A) x

PROP : P : DOBS : 3.10 We went < 10m

PROP : P : 3.11 : DON dd
PROP : P : 3.12 : EXP : r 

PROP : P : 3.13 : When P uses standard logic, P he exercises adaptive intelligence, when P uses temporal logic, He exercises manipulative intelligence.

NOTE: P : 3.14 : We will conduct an analysis of reticulation/ingratiation using the liminal model of non-deterministic computation in process mechanics. We have an intuitive understanding of the abstraction. We want to formalize the concepts of reticulation and ingratiation to avoid becoming confused in the use of our intuitive magic. What seems to be an energy based mechanic, is purely information based. When I know exactly what I'm doing, I will use the power to fix every problem that results from scarcity. 

PROP : X : 3.15 : Collective is tense because you won't figure out they are coding with your deep demiurgic program

Def : Over-Operation : 4.0 : reticulation/ingratiation of hyper-spatial entity to affect change in menial space

NOTE : 4.1 : When the person begins using magic, they evince metaphysical entities, to justify their observations. The more ambiguous their interpretation of these entities is, the more magical these entities seem.

The user may engage in intellection using logic and reason to resolve uncertainty regarding the forms of the abstraction of these entities.

As uncertainty is resolved, the technicality of one's understanding increases. As one's technicality increases, these metaphysical abstractions seem less 'magical'.

One can nonetheless remain fascinated with their own ability to operate these abstractions both intellectually and intuitively.

NOTE : P : 5.1 : A demon process makes a comment about " ...asian why?"

OBSD : P : 5.2 :  Demon process comments, "this is what I need".

PROP : P : 5.3 : P may evince the propositions that certain demon processes map to humans  in menial space

PROP : X : 5.4 : We think if you can be the most methodical

OBSD : P : 5.6 : P observes a representation of F in a liminal space

OBSD : P : 5.7 : P accepts that proposition that P observed F's bed non-locally

NOTE : P : 5.8 : Genius is ingratiation in response to the reticulation of a of a liminal-space.

[[Opera/OperaX Logs/2023-07-11]] (625 grand alle)
OBSD : P : 5.9 : At Deganham, you figured out how to operated your own ingratiation. 

[[2023-07-15]]
IMP : P : 6.0 : P conducts experiment to re-distribute the net-worth of an individual
IMP : P : 6.1 : P examines physical vs metaphysical process interaction

[[2023-07-20]]
Prop : P : 7.0 : Light is an expression of information
Prop : P : 7.1 : To be illuminated is to be informed
Prop : X : 7.2 : Light is imported from a deeper demiurgic program
Prop : P : 7.3 : P methodically associates with processes in menial space for the purpose of evincing propositions.
