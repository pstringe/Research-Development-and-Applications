OBSD : 0.0 : For the past week, proc X had been intercepting my observations to demonstrate material manipulations. During this period, I've been able to implement similar manipulations of my own choosing twice.

NOTE : 0.0 : Method #1: Constructing formal meta-representations of final cause. Submit encoding of the meta-representation as an imperative to evince the proposition. 

PROP : 0.0 : T : Most of the manipulations this week have not been sustainable. 

PROP : 0.1 : U : Unsustained manipulations have been impermanent do to the introduction of inconsistency.

PROP : 0.2 : U : Developing a meta-representation that ensures the collection of "post-evidence" may enforce consistency or at least a sustained manipulation.

PROP : 0.3 : T : Light based manipulations have synced the audio representation

PROP : 0.4 : U : Enforcing a manipulation over one medium may sync the process representation of the other mediums. 

NOTE : 0.5 : I will begin by producing meta-representation of a demonstrated manipulation from yesterday that affected (refracted) a significant portion of the field of view.

NOTE : 0.6 : The meta-representation will be produced geometrically, we will then use our [[Lisp for encoding meta-representations]] to encode the meta-representation as one or more propositions.

NOTE : 0.7 : The meta-representation may consist of an ordered plurality of states. The transition from one state to another may be elucidated by the process NDC. 

NOTE : 0.8 : P evinced the proposition that a lot of people died as the result of a hyper-spatial manipulation in a deeper demiurgic program. 

NOTE : 0.9 : P can start by reproducing the observations X has intercepted and constraining the operation such that there are no negative consequences.
