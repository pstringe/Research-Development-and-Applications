title: 				Process Representation
tags:

0. [Def] **Process**: We define a process as an abstraction that processes information, isomorphic to the theorems of the form described in [Axiom 0.0]
1. [Def] **Observation**: Given a process represented by valid theorem, the output of the process becomes the input when performing the operation defined in [Axiom 0.6]. We refer to this as an observation.
2. [Def] **Discriminatory Observation**: The first term in an observation as described in [Axiom 0.6]
3. [Def] **Generative Observation**: The last term in observation as described [Axiom 0.6]
4. [Def] **Observable Process**: A process where the representation of the input involves the representation of the model.
