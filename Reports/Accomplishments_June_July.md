[[OBJ-MS-0.0_Implement_Metaphysics]]
Regarding implementation of the metaphysics, I've made progress in the following areas:
* Formal description of the observer's paradox using the [abstract calculus](Abstract Calculus|Abstract Calculus) in, [temporal solution to observer's paradox](Temporal Solution to Observer's Paradox)
* Two drafts enumerating the axioms [process calculus](Process Calculus) as a formal meta-representation of the *observer's paradox* in time using the abstraction of an [observable process](Def-4.0-Observable_Process)
* Develop and initial testing of [logic for nondeterministic computation](obsidian://open?vault=Master&file=Research%20and%20Development%2FEquipment%2FIndeterminate%20Logic%2FLogic%20for%20Nondetermisitic%20Computation) to augment the behavior of observable processes.
* Partial Draft of [[Mechanics and Elucidation of Evidence]]
* Progress modeling mutually dependent observable processes (Still need to process notes). 
* Conceptualization of [hyperpoint](Def-PR-0.0-hyper-point.md) abstraction to describe [process representation](obsidian://open?vault=Master&file=Research%20and%20Development%2FFundamental%20Metaphysics%2FProcess%20Representation%2FProcess%20Representation) (Still processing notes).
* Development and initial testing of technique for predictable traversal of *liminal spaces* as the are elucidated in [[Process Representation]] (Notes with-held for privacy concerns)

[[OBJ-MS-0.1_Implement_Ethics]]
Regarding development of the ethics: 
* We've begun compiling tentative ethical propositions for examination. In-depth examination is irresponsible until we've completed our formalizations and simulated process mechanical systems.

* One of the main focuses of the ethical framework is to establish a set of propositions, the acceptance of which will evince the amelioration of the remediation mechanics in place. 

* Our work with [[Process Representation]] and modeling *mutually dependent observable processes* provides a promising foundation for the ethics.

* We've conceptualized two models that describe the remediation mechanics in place. One involving relative representation of mutually dependent observable processes, the other involving an elucidated metaphysical abstraction accounting for the dependency of every conceivable metaphysical abstraction. These models are both describable in a process mechanical system.

* Once the notes are processed and our technical equipment in place, we plan to utilize evolutionary simulations to demonstrate potential solutions to the emergent remediation mechanics of the observer's paradox. These simulations can be carried out using classical computation. As per [[Reductive demonstration of indeterminacy of abstract propositions]] (Notes being processed).

* These simulations should aid in the acceptance of propositions as per [mechanics of evidence generation](obsidian://open?vault=Master&file=Research%20and%20Development%2FFundamental%20Metaphysics%2FProcess%20Mechanics%2FEvidence%20Generation%2FMechanics%20of%20Evidence%20Generation)

* We've conceptualized and begun implementing some tentative solutions, but until the problem is formalized and demonstrated, any tentative solutions are unstable.

* Solving remediation mechanics will solve every problem arising from mutual process representation at every level of abstraction in society. To name a small number of issues that would be solved:
	* Energy scarcity
	* Material resource scarcity
	* Social Inequality
	* Income Inequality
	* ect ...

[[OBJ-MS-0.2_Implement_Evidence_Generation_Methodology]]
* Our evidence generation methodology is a meta-scientific methodology largely dependent on our development of [process mechanics](obsidian://open?vault=Master&file=Research%20and%20Development%2FFundamental%20Metaphysics%2FProcess%20Mechanics%2FProcess%20Mechanics) and [mechanics of evidence generation](obsidian://open?vault=Master&file=Research%20and%20Development%2FFundamental%20Metaphysics%2FProcess%20Mechanics%2FEvidence%20Generation%2FMechanics%20of%20Evidence%20Generation)

* The first objective our evidence generation methodology is to increase the reliability, consistency, and reproducibility of procedures for precisely augmenting the [process representation](Process Representation) of the observer's paradox. This has applications in every domain. 

* The second objective is to lay a strong foundation for several metaphysical engineering projects.

* We've begun work on a [propositional analysis platform](Propositional Analysis Platform) to facilitate the collection of data that will allow us to more effectively analyze the effectiveness of one of our evidence generation methods, utilizing indeterminate temporal logic to augment the behavior of background observable processes.
