The purpose of this sub-problem is to develop a functional representation of pi to utilize in our [Process Representation](Process%20Representation.md) using a base 2 system.

	- [x] establish two dimensions using an isomorphism between a [dimension](Def-POSC-0.2-dimension.md) in positional calculus and a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory) of  numbers to signify positions. ✅ 2023-06-28
	- [x] construct a circle ✅ 2023-06-28
- [x] Use this relation to define the relationship between the radius and the elements of the construction ✅ 2023-06-28
- [ ] Formalize the relationship between the radius of a circle and it's approximate circumference using bisected partitions #formal #equipment
* We encountered a contradiction, $(C > r) \land (C = r)$

- We did not include the partitions in the circumference formula, when we include it the answer makes sense, but we need to increase the precision of our answer, or describe what happens as the precision approaches infinity.
* When the number of partitions increases, we expect the precision to increase
* When p is large, we expect l to shrink and b to increase and approach but not surpass r
* We will assume the radius is one and set $p$ to 2048.
