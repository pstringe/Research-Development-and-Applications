- [x] test and record observations ✅ 2023-07-06
- [x] modify array functions to use char* instead of void. (generalize at a later time if useful) ✅ 2023-07-13- 
- [ ] debug f_strsplit, record observations.
* error: error: incomplete type 'char []' where a complete type is required
* We will go back and check on this value if it becomes an issue
* error: Couldn't materialize: couldn't get the value of variable str: read memory from 0x7ff7bf6ffff8 failed (0 of 8 bytes read)
* error: errored out in DoExecute, couldn't PrepareToExecuteJITExpression
- [x] try adding a pointer ✅ 2023-07-13
- [x] allocate memory instead ✅ 2023-07-14
	- [x] Identify existing function ✅ 2023-07-14

* We're debugging this function 
* We've concatenated the first token onto current
* We're about to recur
* i should equal 5
* i = 4
* we did not skip the delimiter
* In the conditional we should be checking the str instead of cur
- [x] Implement change ✅ 2023-07-14
[2023-07-14](2023-07-14.md)
* We made some changes, no longer passing an index, just manipulating the pointer.
* Observed a seg-fault when running the changes

Debugging Observations
*  l == 3
* tmp = ""
* we save the first word in tmp
