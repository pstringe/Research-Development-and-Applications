- [ ] Update definition of $response$, provide examples.
- [ ] Update definition to enforce first person perspective.
- [ ] Define representative abstraction in [Abstract Representative Calculus](Abstract%20Representative%20Calculus.md) and link

- [ ] Clarify in [Abstract Representative Calculus](Abstract%20Representative%20Calculus.md) that every abstraction in a theorem of abstract representative calculus may be mapped to a theorem in [Representative Number Theory](Representative%20Number%20Theory.md)

- [ ] Develop a way to represent the symbol for observer of f in latex or some other medium
- The following link contains information on how to do this, but we probably need to learn how to actually use latex outside of obsidian.
* https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/13594/how-to-add-a-custom-symbol-to-latex
* we can use a technical equivalent but I want to preserve the beauty of my notation. 
* Here is a latex tutorial that includes a section on custom symbols
* https://riptutorial.com/latex
* We can mathjax it seems:
* https://jojozhuang.github.io/tutorial/mathjax-cheat-sheet-for-mathematical-notation/
* I don't see an obvious way to extend it.
* It may be simplest to build a program that, given a technical syntax, can renders theorems of representative and process calculus and export them for insertion.
* minilibx is suitable for our purposes.
* https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html
* We need to understand how we can convert the output to an exportable format 
* We need
