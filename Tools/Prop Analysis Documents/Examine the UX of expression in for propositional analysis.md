title: 				Generalize our definition of abstraction
tags:
---
![[Def-NLA-1.0-Abstraction]]

## Notes 
* Currently the definition of abstraction doesn't carry explicit meaning for connectives. 
- Relationships are implicit based on the value of related nodes
- By default an abstraction is related to 0 expressed abstractions
- When an abstraction is expressed, we automatically relate the parent abstraction to the child abstractions.
- References to the abstractions in the expression are added in the order they are selected / created to the expression array of the parent abstraction.
