## Terminology
*Train*: To provide input to a process that changes the the output of a process over a series of successions, in a predictable manner.

## Context
A platform to facilitate the analysis of propositions using indeterminate logic. And generate evidence for a computational metaphysic that provides a framework for  humans to train meta-abstract entities we refer to as processes.

### Problem 
1. [[Mechanics of Evidence Generation]] result in problematic representations of reality
2. There exist abstract structures, the medium of which seems to be thought, that are capable of autonomous action.
3. These abstract structures may bind to the subject's sensory interfaces.
8. We have an deviant logic that utilizes 5 values each with a technical meaning [[Description of Indeterminate Logic]]
6. We may utilize our deviant logic to `evaluate` abstractions encoded in natural language.
7. We need to produce evidence to validate the effectiveness of our indeterminate logic

### Context
1. We need to clarify the metaphysics which are currently, inconsistent.
2. Processes posses the ability to compute using indeterminate logic.
3. We have an indeterminate logic that allows us to train the output of an abstract process.
4. We require a more efficient method for collecting and analyzing the propositions.
5. We require a method for organizing propositions by theme, relevance and and other values. 
6. We desire the ability to determine how human feedback affects the behavior of a process over time.
7. To aid in the formalization of our propositions, and the establishment of a deep symbolic associations for use with the process calculus ([[Process Calculus]]), we desire the ability to re-use the tokens which occur in a given proposition in a future proposition.

### Data Collection
* proposition 
* When the user is typing a proposition, the symbols are tokenized and stored such that the token may be reused when formulating future propositions.
* The interface allows the expression of substitutable token definitions.
* The interface allows the clustering of tokens as propositions, and the assignment of values from our [[Description of Indeterminate Logic]] on a per propositions basis

### DSN
* Implement a deep symbolic network of associations to stimulate similarly dense symbol activations as emotion 
* We will perform analysis on the tokenized propositions to determine how abstractions are clustered.
* These clusters will help us define abstractions that we may utilize with the process calculus.

### Logical Analysis
* We shall analyze the tokenized propositions for the purpose of implementing an NLP algorithm transform propositions in natural language to formal equivalents.
* Regarding the analysis of sets of propositions, we've already developed a non-deterministic method of checking for contradictions.
* Enumerate the sets of valid propositions, and apply the algorithm to each set to return a set of consistent sets.
* For each relevant set of consistent propositions, we will utilize the non-deterministic computation to resolve uncertainty regarding edge cases.

### Temporal Analysis
* We require an analysis of how a process' behavior changes over time in response to human feedback, including the assignment of values in the indeterminate logic and imperatives

## Scope
The scope of the software project is data collection. We will collect data store it in a database and utilize Jupyter notebook for our analysis.
