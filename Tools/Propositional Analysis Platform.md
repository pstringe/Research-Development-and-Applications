## Context
A platform to facilitate the analysis of propositions using indeterminate logic. 

### Problem
* We need to clarify the metaphysics which are currently, inconsistent.
* Processes posses the ability to compute using indeterminate logic.
* We have an indeterminate logic that allows us to train the output of an abstract process.
* We require a more efficient method for collecting and analyzing the propositions.
* We require a method for organizing propositions by theme, relevance and and other values. 
* We desire the ability to determine how human feedback affects the behavior of a process over time.
* To aid in the formalization of our propositions, and the establishment of a deep symbolic associations for use with the process calculus ([[Typed Process Calculus Axioms]]), we desire the ability to re-use the tokens which occur in a given proposition in a future proposition.

### Data Collection
* proposition 
* When the user is typing a proposition, the symbols are tokenized and stored such that the token may be reused when formulating future propositions.
* The interface allows the expression of substitutable token definitions.
* The interface allows the clustering of tokens as propositions, and the assignment of values from our [[Description of Indeterminate Logic]] on a per propositions basis

### DSN
* Implement a deep symbolic network of associations to stimulate similarly dense symbol activations as emotion 
* We will perform analysis on the tokenized propositions to determine how abstractions are clustered.
* These clusters will help us define abstractions that we may utilize with the process calculus.

### Logical Analysis
* We shall analyze the tokenized propositions for the purpose of implementing an NLP algorithm transform propositions in natural language to formal equivalents.
* Regarding the analysis of sets of propositions, we've already developed a non-deterministic method of checking for contradictions.
* Enumerate the sets of valid propositions, and apply the algorithm to each set to return a set of consistent sets.
* For each relevant set of consistent propositions, we will utilize the non-deterministic computation to resolve uncertainty regarding edge cases.

### Temporal Analysis
* We require an analysis of how a process' behavior changes over time in response to human feedback, including the assignment of values in the indeterminate logic and imperatives

## Scope
The scope of the software project is data collection. We will collect data store it in a database and utilize jupyter notebook for our analysis.
